It's uncomfortable and a little depressing, but if you repeat the ritual often enough it becomes a tolerable way to spend the evening. You just have to bring your own friends and take advantage of the cheap beer, because it's better with a buzz.\n\nDon't believe me? Let's think back to the dusty basement/garage/rec room that you and all your buddies used to hang out in during high school. If you had friends with money there were ping pong tables, air hockey, pool tables or video games. Of if your friends were more like mine, a TV with rabbit ears. (Doc \u0026 Eddy's is the kid with all the cool shit you never had, even though you volunteered to use the pool table as a bed in between games to save space.)\n\nInvariably the furniture had been cast off by surrounding rooms, relegating it to its current purgatory where collapsed cushions, cracked upholstery and wobbly tables may have mingled with bar stools and high tables, the occasional uncomfortable folding chair thrown in for the asshole that shows up unexpectedly and doesn't have anywhere to sit. Incandescent lights shone down on your little domestic beer swilling group and the walls were barren of adornment because you were too cheap to go buy some crap posters to put up over the yellowing wall paper, and mom didn't like nail holes in her dry wall. (Kinda crappy 70s seating. Nicely played, Doc.)\n\nBut you're pretty much the big shit because your parents are out of town, so you invite all your friends over and hope that some cool older kids come too. But that doesn't happen. (Cuz Eddy's at the bar acting like a skeeze.)\n\nThe creepy old dude that still likes hanging out with high school kids is staring down your cleavage chuckling with his douchewad buddies and declaring with aplomb, \"Nice boobs!\" The jocks are all playing beer pong or clustered around a TV yelling defensive plays at the screen, convinced that the more animated they get the more cred they'll earn with their meat head buddies. A gaggle of girls will descend upon the party later in the evening since they spent an hour getting their hair just right. They'll be wearing makeup that they applied more like spackle and dress in skin tight clothing that advertises every curve, muffin top and camel toe. \n\nSomeone will puke in the bathroom. Some other folks will get all surly and square off or shoot each other bitch eyes for the rest of the night. And you'll end up with something broken, adding to the overall depressing air of the dilapidated rec room.\n\nBut you'll do it all again next weekend.\n\nThat is Doc \u0026 Eddy's.","useful":12,"funny":17,"cool":9}

Go order a Dagwood from Gandolfo's deli. It's roast beef, turkey, ham, pastrami, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, mayo, spicy mustard, salt and pepper, as close to nirvana as I'm ever getting. (In case you couldn't tell by the ingredients, I was a little indecisive about what kind of sandwich I wanted, so I just took the works.)\n\nDuring lunch it can get a little hairy in Gandolfo's deli, and I'm not talking about the number of people there (which is many) but the ratio of males to females (which is very high, me being the only customer lacking a y chromosome). There is a reason why this is so. These sandwiches are monstrous meat and cheese concoctions slathered in sauce and served big. I could easily make a phallic reference about all these men consuming massive hoagies, but I'm going to take the high road this review.\n\nI was considering the hard salami smothered in sauce, but I didn't know if it would be filling enough...\n\nOkay. So the low road suits me better. \n\nI opted for the $2.49 meal deal to complement my Dagwood, which left me with a gigantic sandwich, a quarter pound of potato salad, and a regular iced tea with plenty left over for dinner that night. It was close to ten bucks after tax, which is a little bit on the pricey side, but at least I made two meals of it. \n\nThe potato salad was decent but lacked salt, like they didn't bother boiling the potatoes with this necessary ingredient. I love me some salt. Get me a lick and I'll take a cheese grater to it to season my meals. Or make me a salt flavored ring pop for those mid day cravings. My blood pressure will curse you, but I'll be singing your praises. After adding this magic ingredient Gandolfo's potato salad got pretty good, and they get extra credit for using red potatoes, leaving the skin on, and preparing it with vinaigrette and mayo instead of mustard. Yum!\n\nIt's pretty decent for a sandwich shop and the menu is intimidating in size and offerings. You could do much worse *coughBlimpie'scough*, so give it a whirl if you find yourself in the area.","useful":9,"funny":9,"cool":4}

Eww! *scrunchy nose*\n\nDo shriveled potato skins, overcooked fried zucchini sticks, or soggy hot wings float your boat? Eww. *disdainful sneer*\n\nDoes the fact that they constantly change their specials and scheduled events without notice, luring you into this depressing hole under false pretenses sound dandy? Eww... *depressed sigh*\n\nI live dangerously close to this place, so more often than not I'll end up here when there's a dispute along the veins of: \"Whatta you wanna do tonight? I dunno. How bout you?\"\n\nMost frequently this is the end decision on a Friday night, when they hold live trivia with a host and the opportunity to win 20 to 30 bucks if you come in first or second place. But it's difficult to enjoy some live trivia when it's canceled every other week without any prior notice. That kind of business ethic doesn't instill any loyalty in your customer base. It's also kind of trashy how our winning credits are always hand written in near illegible chicken scratch on a piece of register tape, only redeemable for food, and only on a day other than trivia time. I get it. You want to lure us back on a weekday so we'll spend money in the bar. Klassy.\n\nI wouldn't have such a problem with the place if it the food was at least worth it. The nachos are huge and covered in lots of toppings but it's primarily cheap-o nacho cheese sauce or sour cream, which add little flavor and just make the whole thing a sloppy mess. The wings are soggy and generic (the hot isn't spicy in the least-- maybe they were referring to the temperature?), and there's an absolutely terrible Island Jerk flavor. The zucchini sticks are always overcooked and soggy. The cheese sticks are hard and chewy, not stringy mozzarella. The potato skins look like shriveled little potato abortions adorned by three bacon bits and some nacho sauce. The pizza is pretty decent and probably your best bet. I wouldn't recommend anything else on the menu. They use cheap, bargain basement product and it shows in the quality of the food.\n\nThat leaves the bar to make up for the abysmal food. Too bad that's pretty hit or miss, with an emphasis on the miss. For about a two month stretch Sneakers seemed to change their daily specials week by week if not day by day. One day it would be two dollar ladies mixed drinks all day, next week just 9pm to close. Then it would be two dollar drafts all day, changed to half priced wings during happy hour. I don't like the bait and switch. I understand that a new or struggling place needs to cut costs and redefine its specials but when it's changing that often (too quickly for even the signage on the tables or menus to keep up) there's a serious issue with management that needs to be addressed. \n\nIt seems like they've finally settled things to 75 cent domestic draft beers during happy hour (Coors and Bud) and half priced appetizers. Solid. Then from 9pm to close the daily drink specials start. Good. Keep it simple, stupid.\n\nThe service at least tries to make up for the crappy food and ever changing drink specials. They're always more than patient when it comes to explaining the changes and always apologetic when they get the brunt of our disappointment when we've been victims of the ole bait and switch. \n\nThe decor looks like a tacky college sports fan decorated it with all the tables sporting different teams and mascots, and paraphernalia splashed all over the walls willy nilly. There's also a weird identity problem going on, with some cheap wine prints on display in the bar and a gigantic statue of Uncle Lester from the Addams Family dressed in a referee suit. They offer Rock Band but I've never seen anyone playing it. They offer the Buzztime Trivia but hardly any televisions are ever tuned to it. There's a couple pool tables, darts, a basketball game, Buck Hunter and a couple other video games in the back. It just seems to be having an extreme identity crisis, trying to be something different to everyone, but half assing it so no one ends up satisfied.\n\nThey've taken to serving beer in plastic cups and giving out paper plates for food during happy hour which is a bit on the depressing side. The general vibe makes it seem like it's on the brink of closing any given week, which is too bad because they easily have one of the best patios in Tempe. \n\nIf you're going to go, sit on the patio and enjoy the greenery, cool water, friendly ducks and turtles sunning themselves. It will make you forget just how much of a downer it is inside the place.","useful":10,"funny":10,"cool":8}

Not very comfortable to dine in, but cutesy nonetheless. It also helps that I now work in the surrounding area, since Munch-a-Lunch seems to cater exclusively to the business parks around it. Although it's nothing to write home about, it does a pretty fine job of sating my hunger.\n\nThis small hole-in-the-wall joint caters to those on the go with a five dollar sandwich box that consists of a sammich, bag o' chips, candy bar and canned soda. It's a screaming deal compared to most fast food meal deal prices, and you can be in and out in a few minutes. However, if you're willing to wait around a bit (and maybe try out those funky butterfly chairs or watch an old black and white movie on the tele inside), the made to order specials and salads are usually pretty solid and a good bang for your lunch buck. \n\nOne gripe I have with this place is that the consistency is wildly variable depending on the day. I've ordered the Greek salad numerous times (what can I say, I'm a sucker for beets in a salad) and it's been nigh inedible at times due to a heavy hand with the salty dressing and feta cheese. So order dressing on the side if you're a featherweight like me. At times some items have been a bit stale as well. I've had some unfortunate puff pastry that seemed like it had been freezer burned or microwaved a hair too long. And they have a strange propensity for smothering things in sour cream sauce. \n\nThese are little issues in the overall quality of the food though. Sandwiches and salads are always a solid bet, and the Greek menu items have rarely let me down! \n\nGive it a shot if you're in the area.

I'm the belle of the ball, bitches!\n\nLet me reign in my enthusiasm a bit. I don't generally like Ross. It's trashy, unorganized and sticky. Especially the one in Arizona Mills Mall. (I shudder remembering trying to redeem my gift card there last Christmas. Long lines, cheap whorebag/old granny clothes galore, and it was infested with children.) Typically the majority of clothes at Ross look like they could also be found hanging in my local Goodwill, but I still frequent these crappy stores in hopes of finding a killer deal. (What can I say? I'm a masochist. They keep burning me over, and over and I just line up for the punishment.)\n\nBut this shiny new location in Tempe Marketplace and I are undergoing a golden honeymoon period!\n\nIt just opened so all the fixtures are new and not covered in human grime yet. The clothes here are surprisingly well organized for this type of scavenger hunt shopping experience. I found my sizes exactly where they should be, a first for any Ross-venture. The clothes here are of the same cheap, thin poly-cotton blends that allows them to keep their prices so low, but they've always lasted a fair amount of time and for the price simply can't be beat. The fashions thankfully aren't still stuck in the late 90s era of baby doll tees, and I managed to find pretty dresses for a wedding, Zombie Prom and for when I want to feel like a tulle entwined princess, all for only 40 bucks! Ross is also pretty good for decorating a bathroom, kitchen or living room on the cheap. And the accessories section at this location rocks. Tons of purses, shoes and jewlery.\n\nSo if you're looking for cheap clothes and house accessories that haven't already been pawed at by the masses, go here. Quick! Before it starts to reek of feet and small children.","useful":6,"funny":10,"cool":3}

To avoid compromising the values of my veggie friends by forcing them to make me man meat, it's always best to choose a place with plenty of greens on the menu. Pita Jungle is the perfect harmony between flesh renders and herbivores. And it doesn't just have the \"hold the chicken\" type vegg friendly option on the menu, it's got lentils and shit.\n\nNow, since we've already established that I live under rocks, you can just go ahead and assume I've never been to Pita Jungle. What can I say, the grub hunting was good. But after my first visit you can bet your skinny little vegan ass I'll be noshing right next to you on a regular basis. \n\nThe restaurant has apparently expanded twice since it's been open and it was still hoppin' last night, with an open, airy feel and interesting artwork decorating the walls. We hovered over the seating section booth thingy and were told to go ahead and steal any open seat we liked. Some may find this annoying and unorganized, but I really like it when they let me do that part of their job for them, so we snagged a table for two right next to the window so I could watch some dog TV, which was showing a tig old biddy sorority girl special based on the number of perky young freshman coming and going in the parking lot. (Side note: Big old windows are like big screen dog TVs because dogs don't watch human TV, they keep track of the cats trotting through their territory and bark at the mailman and monitor the comings and goings of the neighborhood through windows. At least in my experience. I'll be sitting there glued to the tube and the dogs will be sitting there glued to the window. End tangent. Thanks for your patience.)\n\nOthers have complained about the poor service at this location, but surprise (sarcasm) Mr. Man ends up knowing the waiter assigned to our section, so we were promptly rewarded with menus and drinks. Not that I would have even noticed the wait since I was agape, trying to take in everything offered on a menu that just wouldn't quit. Eventually I grabbed hold of my indecision and narrowed it down to three options, the black bean burger, the lavosh shawarma wrap, or the Caribbean salad. We agreed that not having hummus simply wasn't an option so I went with the shawarma so I could pep it up with some left over hummus, and I really dig lavosh because it reminds me of saltines, which I don't really like that much, but are scrumptious in flatbread form. Mr. Man decided upon the grilled vegetable salad, because if you've ever met him, he really needs to watch his boyish figure (again, sarcasm).\n\nWe ordered an extra pita for the hummus, which was overkill and we didn't even end up touching it because the \"small hummus\" ended up being freakin' huge and the pita was sized to match. It was smooth and creamy, and garnished with two of my favorite vegetables (or whatever an olive technically is), cucumbers and kalamata olives! My one gripe about the entire meal was that my chicken was overly dry and a smidgen bland, but the hummus more than made up for that lack in flavor. The side Greek salad that came with my wrap was also stupendous, with a hefty amount of feta and a delicious, light vinaigrette to counter that richness. Mr. Man's grilled vegetable salad was also very well done, with crisp veggies, lots of garlic and an awesome dressing. \n\nAnd this delish bounty of fresh, healthy food came to 20 bucks between the two of us and left us with enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I'll definitely be coming here again, and frequently, so I can get my daily dose of granola crunching hippies, sorority sisters, cooler than thou hipsters and SUV driving yuppies with their childrens all in one place.

There were no belly dancers or tarot card readers, both dinner time lures advertised upon entering, since the noon-to-one crowd is generally geared toward the white collar crowd. That eliminated the possibility of a razzle dazzle performance that may have lured another star out of me, leaving the service, ambiance and food to shine on their own.\n\nThe service was adequate. Not really much to say either way on that. I did kind of like the fact that the wait staff was all eating there in a family setting and were just finishing up when I arrived. That immediately raised my expectations, since they wouldn't settle for anything nasty. Also, the kitchen was filled with....Turks! Not a single word of Spanish, which is quite an anomaly in the food service business. Again, my expectations raised.\n\nUpon entering, the customer is given the option of sitting at regular or low seating. I highly recommend the latter, as it consists of plush pillows and short stools arranged around round tables. The main dining area is very open air with warm colors and sparse decorations, but it feels more sterile than the environment created in the adjacent rooms. Within these rooms comfortable open booths and pillows, upholstered in dark, rich colors are accented by decorative lighting that could have been bought from a bazaar and transported straight here. The layout of these side rooms adds to the ambiance and present plenty of opportunity for conversation. \n\nWe all ordered lunch specials, which are composed of rice, pita bread, cabbage slaw and a meat of some sort. The lamb that I ordered was a little on the bland side and stringy. It would have done much better stewed than grilled. I would also highly recommend you trade the plain ole white rice for the biriani rice, which is saffron (turmeric?) based with veggie bits and walnuts. It was savory and scrumptious, the exact opposite of the cabbage slaw, which was an odd combination of vinegar, mint and garlic. It was a little pricey for a lunch special, ringing in at $10.95 without beverages, and the dinner specials are even more expensive.\n\nI would come here a second time for the atmosphere, and maybe for the belly dancing, but I would definitely try something else off the menu.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Because it's more like that neglected house down the street owned by the Cat Lady that has chipped paint and an overgrown yard, but when you stop there on Halloween she always has those awesome popcorn balls. Or that ottoman that's a little frayed around the edges and is patched with duct tape to keep the upholstery skirt on, but it's the comfiest damn foot rest. \n\nDespite the looks, the bar is a local watering hole that attracts your quirky neighbors. Someone brought in the pelt of a javelina they'd shot the day prior to show it off to his buddies. Ever seen one of those ugly things up close? You just might get the chance if you decide to check it out. Chuy's two doors down will serve as a neon-lit mecca for mass consumption, while Baseline Pub will remain the watering hole in the wall that's a little more mellow and a little rougher around the edges.\n\nHappy hour is twelve hours long, from ten to ten, so they don't really have any drink specials, but the prices are cheap so that's not really an issue. Plus there's the requisite pool tables that every good dive has, so you've got something to occupy your time in addition to conversation with the locals.\n\nThe down side is that the mixed drinks are a bit on the weak side, so stick with beer. The music selection kind of sucks at times, with either country western or classic rock playing. (Cross your fingers for the classic rock.)

If it was a dinky little independent establishment it would never receive the exposure that it does at Tempe Marketplace and probably would have a hard time staying solvent, regardless of how much we adoring Yelpers build it up.

I wanted to jump behind the counter, tidy up that terrible mess and help a dude out, then give that flirty flit at the end of the counter a piece of my mind. \n\nI get the disenfranchisement you feel when being paid slightly over minimum wage, but have a little respect for customer service and the integrity of your shop or you won't have one to report to for long.","useful":16,"funny":8,"cool":8}

Well that didn't take very long to decide.\n\nI've eaten at this location several times. The last time was with a very large group of people, and I got to try many different things off the menu. It basically boiled down to two flavor categories: spicy or non-spicy. The spicy dishes tasted like they had been prepared in one stock sauce. The non-spicy dishes tasted like they had been prepared in a similar sauce that omitted the chili oil. Here and there they added other things, like black bean paste or some sweetness, but most of the dishes tasted pretty much the same. I suppose this is why the menu doesn't go into detail when describing the difference between entrees, just listing \"Mongolian Chicken\" or \"BC Hot and Spicy Chicken,\" since just the veggies and protein are interchangeable and no really strong flavor characterizes any one dish. \n\nWe started off with the appetizer sampler: Sesame Honey Chicken, BC Egg Rolls, Coconut Shrimp, and Pot Stickers. Everything was perfectly adequate and worth the price since it served 4 people. The chicken was crispy, sweet and sprinkled with sesame seeds. The egg rolls tasted like they had been fried in old oil, but I fixed that by dousing it in hot mustard. The coconut shrimp were thin, crunchy, and not too sweet. The pot stickers were steamed with a delicious pork filling, probably the best thing on the tray. It was all pretty good filler before the meal. But it's kind of a sad affair when the appetizers trump the actual main course...\n\nEverything came out really fast for a group of nine people and was piping hot. We shared it family style and here's the details, from best entree to worst:\n*Cantonese Noodles- Wicked fricken good! If I end up going again, I'm definitely ordering this dish. Shrimp, scallops, BBQ pork, chicken and Asian vegetables with wheat noodles tossed in a light but flavorful sauce.\n*Grilled Halibut- Well cooked and flaky. Mango and pineapple salsa was decent and the presentation was very well done.\n*Chicken with Asparagus- I was barely able to distinguish the black bean sauce it was supposedly cooked in, but the chicken was tender and the asparagus al dente. \n*BC Spicy Chicken- This falls under the 'spicy' category of food flavoring. It was a little spicy, a little sweet, and very generic. Supposedly their equivalent of 'Kung Pao,' but it tasted...weirder than any other Kung Pao I've had. \n*Mandarin Orange Scallops- Tough and overcooked, same flavors as the BC Spicy Chicken but with more sugar and no kick. The crispy spinach was interesting though.\n*Bamboo Bejing Duck- It was overcooked and dry rather than being crispy. The Asian pancakes were also dry, but the accompanying plum sauce lubricated things well enough. \n*Pad Thai Rice Noodles- Turned into a sticky noodle block after the first couple minutes. I've made the equivalent from a box in the 'Asian foods' aisle at Fry's. \n*Thai Curry Chicken and Shrimp- The Bamboo Club needs to focus on their Chinese offerings instead of their piss poor Thai dishes. Not good by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nThe side dishes were, like the appetizers, respectable but not amazing. The Dynasty Fried Rice tasted a lot like any other fried rice you'd order. No surprise or disappointment there. The Woked Mushrooms were very well cooked in a light sauce. Much better than most of the entrees even though it was a side dish. The Woked Asparagus had the same flavor as the mushrooms, both of which tasted suspiciously similar to the Chicken with Asparagus. Perhaps it just lacked the dollop of black bean paste?\n\nSo if you go, go for the ambiance. The patio is nice for Mill Avenue people watching and secluded enough to enjoy your meal with a little privacy. The service is attentive and quick to refill any glass or comply with your requests, even for a large group of people. At the very least these guys deserve the high tips generated by pricy entrees. It's too bad the food is so damn generic. Definitely not worth the 13-25 dollar price tag per entree. \n\nMaybe happy hour is the best option for attending this place? Cheap three dollar appetizers and drink specials without the unnecessary disappointment of crappy food? Maybe I'll give it a whirl in the future.\n\nIf you're wrangled into dinner there, go with the Cantonese noodles, crispy spinach and woked veggies. Best stuff on the menu. Or risk it and order something else. Maybe I went on an off night...but I doubt it since this is a corporate chain the same the country over.","useful":5,"funny":4,"cool":4}

Yeah, neither do I, but I've been told from the horse's mouth (sorry to call you a horse, Mr. Man) that it used to be a hip and happening place with plenty of small, custom shops and dives instead of the now ubiquitous mega-corporate whorebaggery. Luckily, you have only to travel a little bit further west on University to steep yourself in that old school neighborhood feel. \n\nThai Basil gets big stars for being one of these homey neighborhood joints. Along with El Pollo, Tops, Tempe Bicycle, HTC, Otto's, Headquarters, Buffalo, etc., this locally owned restaurant has consistently provided inviting ambiance, wonderful service and delicious food for pennies compared to anything on Mill.\n\nI just finished my leftover red curry chicken just before I wrote this, and it was every bit as savory and rich as it was last night (just make sure to put the leftover sticky rice in a plastic bag or it'll get crusty). The fragrance and flavor of all their curries (red, green, yellow, and peanut) is if not unmatched, pretty damn close to the best offered at any Thai place I've dined. Thick, al dente, crinkle cut carrots, bamboo shoots, green beans, broccoli, zucchini, red and green peppers with tender choice of meat afloat in savory coconut milk that suspends the perfect amount of earthy spice and hot chili to ensure that the meal dances on your taste buds.\n\nMy favorite dishes aside, just about everything on the menu at Thai Basil has proved to be exemplary. The Thai Basil is their signature dish and certainly doesn't skimp on its namesake fresh basil and thick flavorful sauce. The Pad Thai is sure as hell better than what's offered at Bamboo Club, with ample crushed peanuts and noodles that don't turn into a puddle of goo once the dish cools. The Garlic Pork has a lighter sauce that still manages all the fragrance and flavor of its more syrupy counterparts. The papaya salad is crisp, citric, sweet and spicy, an excellent accompaniment to a rich meal. Or try the crispy spring rolls that manage to be filling despite their humble size. The chicken satay with peanut sauce is also a very good choice for picky eaters (or kiddos), although they'll truly miss out on the more complex flavors of this amazing food. \n\nThai Basil is a fairly small restaurant with dark wood tables that are all very closely spaced to ensure the maximum number of people can be seated. There is booth seating along the back and stretching the length of one side, while high tables and chairs are located in the windowed area facing Farmer. The decorations are sparse but complement the overall Asian feel, with bamboo accessories, knick knacks and family pictures decorating the walls. The richly colored, metallic embroidered skirt/pants worn by the waitresses are also for sale if you're looking for something special to spice up your wardrobe.\n\nDespite its small size, I've never experienced the long wait times that others have when I come here. The servers have always been very attentive and quick to refill a glass or take my order, and are honest with their opinion when asked what they enjoy on the menu. I don't generally go here on busy nights though, and the hours I attend are either early or late evening, so maybe I avoid the hectic rush, because the kitchen is pretty small. At least you know you're getting fresh Thai from the folks who know it best as a result. If you don't have a lot of time to wait and just want a quick dinner, it's also possible to phone in your order or walk in, order, visit the shops around the restaurant and return in ten minutes to a piping hot order.\n\nTry out the lunch specials! They're a great deal and they get you in and out within the hour. Although this is the one time of the day I've been when it's a bit on the slow side, since the entire restaurant is always packed. But the crowd is oddly well staggered since I've never seen anyone waiting for a table. For about eight bucks you get a small salad with tangy sweet vinaigrette, a spring roll with sweet and sour sauce, and your choice of dish with a ball of rice on the side. It's usually enough so I have one extra lunch leftover, compared to the two lunches I usually have with the regular dinner dishes. \n\nOne thing I've noticed over time is that their \"hot\" really isn't that hot, so if you like it spicy, make sure to specify. \n\nThai Basil is a comfortable neighborhood restaurant that attracts the type of customers Mill Avenue only wishes it could, loyal ones. As Mill whores itself out to the highest corporate bidder, I envision the property owners diving through coins like Scrooge McDuck and doing their best impression of Mr. Burns'. But the obscene retail rent checks signed reflects the boost in product price and the blandness of corporate hegemony. It's a relief for this starving-but-no-longer-student to support a local eatery by driving just a little west of that circus.","useful":9,"funny":5,"cool":8}

(And the reason why they enforce a three margarita limit.)\n\nUnfortunately, they'll run you 6 to 9 bucks depending on how much razzle dazzle you're going for. The Sixth Street Margarita is the most basic, frozen or on the rocks, and is delicious. So is the Z Top Shelf, and the Chambord, and the Frozen Watermelon, and the Grand Marnier, and I think you're sensing the trend here.\n\nAnd the food... Well, it exists so you don't leave in the condition discussed above. It's not as good as the margaritas, but once you have a couple, you're really not going to care that much.\n\nBrunch is the best time to hit this place up and indulge in a three dollar mimosa, their three dollar top shelf do-it-yourself bloody mary bar (with all the fixins, including beef jerky stir sticks!), or the epic margaritas. The chicken and potato hash is decent, but it used to be much better back when it was the savory sage chicken and potato hash and had, how do you say, actual flavor. Now it's just blah by comparison. Well done blah. But blah all the same (although Mr. Man loves it). So you may want to hit up the smothered burrito or jerk chicken salad instead, both of which are delicious. \n\nHappy hour is also a pretty good deal, with one dollar off all drinks and half price appetizers. I'd recommend the Cast Iron Skillet Dumplings that are like crispy round Asian pot stickers that come out sizzlin' in sweet chile sauce or the Tortilla Soup, which is done really, really well here with avocado and lots of chunky chicken. \n\nBut forget the food. It's the backup vocals to the wailing showboat sex symbol of a lead singer that runs back stage for a mid show sex/drug/booze binge while his second tier stand-in entertains the crowd with a limp solo. \n\nThe margaritas are bad ass and they know it.

Drunken frat boys playing alpha male and sorority girls doing their slutty exhibitionist thing just hit a sour note. However in the off hours of college binge drinking, say Saturday day drinking or summer and winter break, I really enjoy me some Mill Avenue. One of my favorite places on the strip is Fat Tuesdays.\n\nYou see, I have a weakness. And that weakness is slushy drinks. Slush puppies, Mr. Mistys, Icees, and the mother of them all...the pina colada. Which in a nutshell is why I like Fat Tuesdays. It's pure sugar and ice blended into a melange of delicious. Granted, all the red frozen drinks taste the exact same, but the 190 Octane, Pina Colada thing, Blue Raspberry and Mango are delicious flavors that end in big old hangovers if you overindulge. But since they're frozen, it takes much longer to sip one down than a regular mixed drink, saving you money and still messing you up (provided you go the 190 Octane route). \n\nMake sure to try an Atomic Cherry (or Nuclear Cherry or whatever they're called) for 50 cents while you're there. It's a downright painfully delicious experience. If you go with a group, which is recommended because you have to bring your own posse of fun up to Mill Avenue, splurge for a round of them. Then watch even the manliest macho man agree that those everclear soaked cherries are a painful bitch to confront.\n\nBut under all circumstances, don't get the food.

Unfortunately the ingredients reflected the price, they never so much as purchased a sign, and it ended up going out of business in less than a year. \n\nI can only cross my fingers and hope that the same doesn't go for Dragonfly Vietnamese Kitchen. The original is wicked fantastic and located in Mesa that has been around for a couple years and consistently produces some great pho (tripe and tendon anyone?), papaya salad and noodle dishes I have ever had. And at this new location they've created a sleek, urban eatery that fits right in with the rest of the locations on Mill Avenue, but manages to trump them in every respect. (Price, service, ambiance, and of course, the FOOD.)\n\nDragonfly just opened a week ago and has a large banner instead of a sign advertising their presence, but judging by the lunch time crowd, word of mouth has really worked for this place. Their lunch time specials are impressive, with offerings of papaya salad, spring bowls, rice plates, several types of pho and Vietnamese sandwiches with soup or ginger vinaigrette dressed greens as a side for a humble...wait for it...$7.50. I'm still baffled at how they can offer such plentiful, healthy, delicious food at such a reasonable price.\n\nThe soup of the day was Dungeness crab and asparagus soup, and there was no way I was passing up crab soup for a measly salad. It was such a good decision to go with double soup (pho and soup du jour) because it was peppered broth with HUGE chunks of real crab, asparagus, mushrooms and baby corn that was out of this world! We ordered the spring rolls as well, which were also HUGE with poached pork and shrimp, vermicelli noodles, mint, lettuce, bean sprouts, and cucumbers wrapped in rice paper and served with some of the best spicy peanut sauce I have ever had. The soup and spring rolls would have made a perfectly adequate lunch, but once the pho arrived, I dropped everything for this brothy delight.\n\nIt was served in a HUGE (picking up on the trend here?) square bowl with thin slivered beef, vermicelli, and scallions and garnished with bean sprouts, lime wedges, fresh mint, jalapenos, sriracha chili sauce, hoisin sauce and soy sauce. Any combination of these additional ingredients will result in a savory concoction that can help you nurse a cold or open your sinuses, all while warming you to the core. It's fresh, healthy, light and scrumptious! I can see myself eating her very, very often in the future, and straying from my usual order of pho to branch out and try other things on their menu, all of which are still reasonably priced for a Mill Avenue joint (FUCKING SUCK IT BOA!) at 8 to 12 bucks an entree. I would also highly recommend the fresh squeezed limeade, made with sparkling seltzer water instead of still, which was a refreshing spritz of flavor. They also have a full bar, a must for Mill Avenue joint.\n\nThe outdoor patio is surrounded by a pretty twisted wrought iron canopy exit at the front of the store and will offer a lovely dining experience since the weather has started to cool down. Inside the restaurant, the color scheme (green, white, plum and black) and ambiance create a fresh, vibrant, urban feel with large bamboo fixtures nested in beds of smooth black rocks. After talking to our server we were also informed that they hope to have a mellow live musical act in the middle of the restaurant in the near future for diners to enjoy. \n\nThe service was also AMAZING! Prompt, friendly, easy on the eyes, and attentive. The food was ready lightening fast (almost too quickly considering our first courses, but I can see how the speed is great for getting people on a lunch break in and out) and the waiter was charming, making sure we got everything we could possibly need at lightening speed. \n\nI really, really, REALLY hope this place does well because I want to become a regular here. So go check it out and support a local business rather than a shitty chain on Mill Avenue. I can only hope more of these gems continue to pepper this ever increasing stretch of vapid consumerism, so I don't end up feeling like a corporate whore after my meal. Don't want to taint a dining experience this good with whoredom.\n\n*****UPDATE*****\nThey have happy hour specials now from 3pm to 7pm! Half price appetizers: Tamarind chicken wings, lettuce wraps, crispy shrimp wontons, hoisin glazed spare ribs, and Vietnamese salt 'n pepper calamari! Domestic bottles 2 bucks, Imports for only a buck more, top shelf well drinks for 5 bucks, and house wine for 3 bucks.\n\nThursday through Saturday they have live jazz on the patio from 7pm to 10pm. Best thing of all? They extend their happy hour appetizer and drink specials to their customers during this time. So you could eat and drink cheaply anytime between 3pm and 10pm Thursday and Friday!

I don't like waiting for the first meal of the day. I turn into the reckapotamus from Hell, whose disposition is a combination between that of a pissed off hippopotamus and an icy cold imp from the underworld. \n\nBut there wasn't a soul to be found enjoying a Tasty Kabob...it was a strange Twilight Zone of inactivity. Everyone and their mother was next door at Pita Jungle, but just because there are a lot of people there doesn't mean it's any good, just that they prefer to flock toward mediocrity, like sheep, or lemmings.\n\nHalfway through the meal, I was thinking about flocking too. \n\nAlthough the hummus came with olives, chopped tomatoes and herbs, it was a bit bland overall. The pitas were warm and delicious though, and the combination of hummus and flat bread helped keep the reckapotamus banished to the depths. It was a generous portion for two, but I found myself munching on it just to pass the time until our lunches came, not because it was exceptionally well done.\n\nSo I wasn't ravenous when my meal arrived, but I was certainly looking forward to some good eats. Alas, the chicken schwarma pita sandwich delivered the same mediocre impression. The chicken was overly dry and not well seasoned, and again, the pita was the star of the dish. \n\nI didn't have the Persian ice cream this time, but I have in the past. It's fairly cheap and delicious, so if any of you out there are interested in trying a flavor that's certainly not of the 31 at Baskin Robbins, give it a whirl. I'm considering giving this place another star based on the ice cream alone...but I can't bring myself to. So consider it a 3.5 star experience overall.\n\nI'm just glad the prices were reasonable for lunch, six or seven bucks for a sandwich. Otherwise, I might have felt a bit cheated. The ambiance was lacking as well, with generic cafeteria type seating (as stated before), and the service as attentive but awkward since we were the only people in there, so that leaves the food alone to shine.

But I can't abide paying ten to twelve bucks for a fast food burger, fries and a drink. That's crazy cakes. \n\nGranted the burger is juicy perfection, grilled to order with as many custom toppings as your hardening arteries can handle. They have two in particular that get me salivating every time: grilled mushrooms and onions. That alone should warrant a fourth star, especially since they don't cost an extra couple bucks a pop like most places. But it's still a six freakin' dollar burger. If they hadn't plastered their walls with newspaper reviews exalting how cheap their eats were, I would probably be a bit more accommodating, but more than ten bucks for a fast foodie burger meal just ain't on.\n\nI do also like that they offer a mini version of their two patty big madre burger, for the wimps like me out there. Regardless, I would recommend keeping the foil around your burger and peeling it away like the burritos from Chipoodle. This will guarantee that all those slippery little grilled mushroom and onion tidbits stay in place, because they're seriously too good to get away. \n\nThe french fries are also in the style that I like, freshly fried up with the bejeezus salted out of them. Ten billion times better than the fresh but somehow still super bland and lifeless matchsticks that In \u0026 Out serves. The Cajun style fries are just sprinkled with seasoned salt. A bit of a let down from what I was expecting but a nice change in pace since it's usually curly fries that get the seasoned salt treatment. Also if you're a limey barstard like me you can grab a bottle of malt vinegar from the side counter and use it to drown your fries. So good.\n\nI also dig on the free peanuts. I realize this is a polarizing issue considering the risk of nut allergies out there, but I like it. When I was a kid I used to judge the caliber of an establishment by whether or not I could throw peanut shells on the ground. Sadly, that has changed very little with the years because I still get a kick out of doing it. \n\nAlright. I've talked myself into it. It's getting an extra star.

The service was spotty (as has been mentioned before) with a couple folks doing quadruple duty as wait staff, busser, host(ess), and cashier.

The fact that it's a family run joint is the reason why everyone does double time during the lunch rush. The ambiance is a little dated but it's quaint, and the amount of heart this establishment has compared to any other fast food Mexibertos or bland, hot garbage like Macayos is unmatched.\n\nThis is Arizona-style Mexican food, make no mistake about it. The Mecca of Mexican food is rooted firmly in Mexico and this place is the Copper State's take on it. Mounds of freshly pressed tortillas and chips made from snowy white peaks of manteca (lard), fresh salsa with the perfect amount of spice, green sauce that will blow your mind and rice an' beans that are good enough to stand on their own.\n\nJust remember: Gollo burro, green style.

I like my cheese steaks bastardized. Hold your cheese whiz. Drop the beef and toss on some chicken. And make sure to add vegetables. Yes, vegetables. Blasphemy, I know. Give me mushrooms, onions, green peppers, tomatoes. Mmmm. In fact, you could even hold the meat and I would be alright with that. \n\nThe hot sandwiches at Corleone's are a happy medley of these two extremes. For the purists, there's the Philly Original and for us West Coast blasphemers there's everything from Buffalo Chicken to Veggie Subs. The fries are pretty decent (it takes some real effort--or neglect--to fuck up french fries) but the onion rings leave a lot to be desired. \n \nI've tried a couple different hot sandwiches, including the Philly Original, and it's always a greasy, messy event. The majority of the time the juice and grease of the contents melt right through the damn roll, leaving me with a pile of napkins, a mangled sandwich, and a frown on my face. (I really dislike it when my food falls apart. I usually bite of it as hard as I can to try and inflict pain on the offending meal. The food has never acknowledged my attack. It's a pretty irrational tradition.) So if keeping your sandwich in one edible piece is big in your book, I wouldn't recommend this place. \n\nThe actual restaurant is pretty small, with a long bar with stools and several high tables to enjoy your vittles at. It's also a little bit on the hot side since half of the restaurant is the kitchen, and it gets a bit noisy with all the ordering, grilling and chit chat, but it's a really lively atmosphere and they offer delivery or take out if you're in a hurry. They're open really late too, especially on the weekends, in order to cater to the Mill Avenue night life.\n\nOn Tuesdays they have a special that's pretty ace. It's a buy one get one deal on any sandwich in the place--of equal or lesser value (just imagine that in small print)--so you and a friend can eat for cheap or you've got one sandwich for dinner and another for lunch the next day.\n\nI know a lot of people that adore this place, but it's just not my thing. Cheese steaks are not the food of gods to me, but if the thought of hot beef and cheese whiz has you gargling saliva like Homer Simpson, you'll probably enjoy it and rate it higher.","useful":6,"funny":8,"cool":6}

I had a glass of Ethiopian honey wine to go with it. It was incredible. I was so glad we added the fish because that was by far my favorite, followed by the spicy beef. The cabbage and potatoes was pretty delicious too, though I didn't really find one thing I didn't care for. It was very flavorful and the injera was the perfect addition. The wine was great also. \n\nThe service was pretty slow, which became an issue with us wanting to hit up sweet republic after and we had to hunt down our check ourselves.

Hands down. I'm also making this claim without having ever been past the patio. If you don't believe me, check out the amazing photos I added.\n\nThe patio is so gorgeous and serene you don't even realize you're right down smack dab in the middle of college central. The vines growing along the side and the umbrellas suspended from the roof are simply magnificent. The place settings are beautiful, and listening to the birds tweet as they hop around all while a great breeze blows makes it instantly calming enough to warrant going by yourself, serene enough for talking business, and sexy enough for a date. \n\nThe staff is phenomenal, and our server, Bri, was just the best ever. She helped me through some very tough Sunday morning meal decisions as well as explained all about Caffe Boa and how many of their items on their dinner and new brunch menu are made from scratch, organic, and/or locally grown. The brunch menu also has only been around a few weeks. I'm glad that I stopped by before word spreads.\n\nI started off with the white sangria, which wasn't sold by the glass until brunch. Additionally, during brunch, the pitchers of sangria are half off. The glass was huge and full of flavor and goodness. It was filled with apples, grapes, oranges, and cherries and was absolutely delightful. After the sangria, I had to try the mimosa, and I was not disappointed. Mimosas, Bellini, and champagne are 8 per glass or 18 bottomless at brunch. And yes, you can mix and match them. It may sound a little pricey, but they would kick the ass of the 2 dollar mimosas many places have. Total weaklings they are compared to this masterpiece.\n\nAfter going round and round on just what I wanted to order, I settled on the eggs benedict which had prosciutto, poached eggs, and basil hollandaise over an English muffin. On the side was an amazing goat cheese and tomato (though I did without tomato). I added some cracked pepper and unbleached wine rock salt. Decadent. Simply exquisite. I don't typically care for salt and I couldn't help but keep putting a tiny pinch on my meal. \n\nThe service was just the right speed for a brunch, not too fast and not too slow. I don't like to be rushed on a Sunday morning. I was able to enjoy myself and take in the amazing food I was eating as well as enjoy the scenery, which made me believe I really had been transported to a gorgeous countryside when I walked in the door. \n\nI will gladly come here again for brunch, and despite my typical dislike of pasta, the description Bri gave us, has me craving that as well.\n\nIt was decadent down to every last tiny detail and I left completely satisfied from head to toe, like I had been on a romantic getaway or a day at the spa.","useful":6,"funny":1,"cool":4}

Well worth it.  In addition we had a side of roti for the curry order and it was some delicious bread. Probably the best bread I've had aside form nan. Why do other countries make bread so much better than us? Is it because we all try to swear ourselves off of carbs?\n\nTo drink, I had pink ting. I know, not surprising. It was a carbonated pink grapefruit beverage using Jamaican pink grapefruit, bottled in Jamaica, but a product of Canada. That made me giggle, but it was delicious.

There are several different layouts to pick and all of them are two story with a garage. Vaulted ceilings add to their charm. \n\nOverall I enjoyed living there and the community was gorgeous. Very green grass, gorgeous little courtyard areas between apartments. Several times people would not believe me when I said they were rentals. \n\nHowever, over time, it didn't remain in the same condition it was in when I moved. More ASU students and so forth have started moving in and abusing the rules. I like to party as much as the next, but what I don't like is waking up at 6am because someone decided it was appropriate to stop in the middle of the road by my place, start their car and just get out of it and leave it running for a half hour.  I didn't enjoy the people walking their dogs without leashes. To clarify, I love dogs, and I've had dogs running loose in my own yard. But not everyone likes dogs and you may walk past someone who is scared. Your dog may also become spooked for some reason and react. I didn't enjoy people ignoring the no glass in the pool rule, which resulted in the pool having to be emptied, cleaned and refilled.. especially when it was hot out. I also didn't enjoy one pool. The community is built on an old golf course and was way too big for one pool. It has two different addresses and entrances for crying out loud.\n\nAlso note there's a mandatory valet trash fee. This is so you don't have to take your trash to the big bin that's probably not too far from your house. \n\nMaintenance was fairly reliable but I did find myself having to call to find out what happened with a call or double check to make sure someone did make the call on occasion. Moving out was for the most part painless. I cleaned and made sure everything was in pristine condition and turned my keys in and was done with it. \n\nIn the end, it's a nice place.

I had an hour to kill before a dinner appointment at Tempe Marketplace, and figured it the perfect chance. \n\nThe man that met me at my car tried to read me at nearly every point in the conversation and adjust his next line/tone appropriately, but made it very apparent he was doing so and it almost made me walk out. I told him I needed a wash and a hand wax and that I had an hour tops in order to have this done. He tried to then sell me on a detail, which my car didn't need at the time. After I told him such he's like \"Oh yeah. Looks like you are right on track of what your car needs and when. The inside looks fine.\"\n\nAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.\n\nI was glad to get away from him and inside.\n\nI went and paid and the inside is your typical upscaled car wash approach that's happened as of late. There were some televisions playing various general channels, some snacks, some random shit for your car, some blue mountain greeting cards (I totally thought those were only e-cards from the mid 90's) and some various seating where you can watch your car at different stages. You can also watch outside which is nice. \n\nI like to watch my car when it's being washed, serviced, what not. I like to know what's going on. Call me an overly possessive parent and you are probably right. My car's my baby. Sadly, I had to move three times in the process of my car being washed to keep an eye on it. I wonder if they do this on purpose. \n\nWhen it was done I stood up to head over. A man asked me if my brakes were bad, to which I responded no and then asked why. He told me they made a loud noise. When I told him it was probably because they were wet he insisted it was not and that I should get my brakes checked. Ends up they didn't make any noise at all, it was another car and he didn't know what the hell he was talking about.\n\nOn the good side, they did take damn good care of my car, so the next time I feel a little feisty after a long day, I'll head over here to have my car washed.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The first and only trip was enough for me. However, about two months or so ago, I was invited to a lunch for a project I was on, and I hesitantly went. The lunch was back to back with a meeting I had... knowing this, and my issues last time, I arrived a half hour early with another coworker to make sure my order was in. We each ordered three rolls if I remember correctly. After we ordered, the others arrived (please note, it took a half hour to be able to put our order in... even though no one was in the restaurant).\n\nEveryone else began to put theirs in as well and sushi and other ordered items began to arrive. 20 more minutes passed and I soon realized everyone had their food but me. Even those that ordered after. It was now close to my time to leave so I flagged down our server and asked him if I could have my sushi to go. I wasn't extremely hungry, but knew I would be craving something by mid afternoon.\n\nIt all went downhill from here. Rather than checking on my order or anything else for that matter, I was attacked and accused of not putting an order down. After all, had it been, it obviously would've been at the table. After 5 minutes of several people ensuring him my order was on a list, I gave up and said to just bring me a philly roll quick so I can not starve myself. One of my coworkers graciously gave up his take home items so I could eat. I was ever thankful.\n\nI left angry and upset...but thanks to friends not completely starving. The food was good, but quickly overlooked by the terrible service I've received both times I've been here. Honestly the food is the only thing that gives them the 2nd star. I bitched on twitter about my disdain and soon had a message from their corporate office. They wanted to call me to discuss the matter with that locale. I told them I didn't really wish to speak with the locale. What's done is done. I wasn't sure what they could honestly say to make me feel better about how I was treated.\n\nKabuki responded with a rather generous gift card. I decided I would give them one more shot (after all, it was on the house). Honestly I was scared to use it... even with the meal being free, I wasn't sure I could handle the stress of another bad experience. It took me nearly a month to use it.\n\nThis past week, I returned and took with me the kind coworker who offered me their take home sushi. We made sure to go on a day where we didn't have any appointments immediately after lunch. We also arrived early. Once again, the place was practically empty. There were only 4 other people there. \n\nWe started off with drinks as we pondered the menu. The drinks my friends, are heavenly. I had a lychee mojito and an apple saketini and practically downed them in one gulp. Filled to the brim, tasteful and beautiful works of art they were. \n\nWe both ordered a few different items. I got two rolls and some nigiri. I was honestly shocked at the relatively ok speed at which they came out. We received our sushi about a half hour after ordering it. Still not super fast, but well, it's better than not getting it at all. The presentation was decent and the sushi was delicious. My ebi nigiri came with a tempura shrimp in the shape of a bunny. That creeped me out a lot. Please don't do that.\n\nIn the end, the service is still slow enough and I've had so many bad experiences there, that I would not trust it for lunch. It will never be in my top 5 places to go at any point in time. However, if I end up arriving at Tempe Marketplace 3 hours early for an event, or if someone wants to go to grab a saketini, I will consider it. The only saving grace this establishment has is it's corporate office, a saketini, and decent sushi (once you get it).\n\nThere are rumors that my picture may be in the back of the restaurant as a warning for when I come in.... hopefully this is not the reason I had a slight improvement in service.","useful":6,"funny":3,"cool":3}

It is not like some of the other sub chains where they are trying to play beat the clock and smash your food together with little care or courtesy so you end up with a flat messy sandwich.

Back east the thrift stores are not all clean and pretty like Savers or the giant Goodwills here in  AZ.  This place also doesn't have as high of prices as the clean and organized stores so you are more apt to find a bargain here.  \n\nGracie's is in an older building along Apache that always seems to have some water leaking and doesn't pipe in scents through the air system to mask the fact that you are buying someone else's old stuff. (I just realized that Goodwill does fragrance the air with cinnamon, I thought I was losing my mind until I noticed it in three separate Goodwills in the valley.)\n\nThey always have a lot of nice clothing, housewares and a lot of books.  I was in there recently and there seemed to be a lot less inventory so I don't know if they were just slow on donations or maybe clearing out to possibly renovate.  Getting to the place has been a nightmare recently because of the light rail construction so if you know your Tempe streets I would suggest coming in from the neighborhood behind the store, not off of Apache.\n\nGracie's is affiliated with Grace Community Church in Tempe and does have some religious literature near the front counter and has an abundance of Christian books for sale on their shelves.","useful":8,"funny":6,"cool":2}

I knew that I desperately needed to do something since my dog was overly aggressive to people and other dogs, but I was worried about her being too old and stuck in her ways to change. Dennis proved me wrong in the first 10 minutes of meeting him. I had never seen my dog be so attentive before. After just 3 sessions, my dog has made insane amounts of progress. Typically, my dog cannot be around other people or dogs as she acts very aggressive. Her bark is so loud and alarming that people typically RUN the other direction when they hear her. We were having to plan walks around when we wouldn't run into anyone. I just got back from a walk with her now and my mind is blown. The leash was slack the entire time, she sat whenever I stopped walking, and she even politely greeted another dog/dog owner on the way! I cannot thank Dennis enough for all of his expertise and efforts. I went from hopeless to hopeful in such a short amount of time. I can't wait to see what else he can teach my dog in the future!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I grew up essentially hanging out here with my friends in high school, getting fancy with our buttered noodles with different sauces each time..\n\nHowever, this was a sore disappointment. My husband and I have been here several times and each time it's mediocre at best. Tonight (8/4/15) I had the BBQ Pork Sandwich with a cup of Chicken Noodle Soup. Unfortunately, the pork tasted fairly bland (except for that burn of pepper in the back of my mouth) and it felt like it had been shredded, then under a heat lamp, drying it out and making it super chewy. It even looked like how pork looks when it's been sitting on the edge of a slow cooker for hours... Very unappetizing.\n\nThe chicken noodle soup EVERY TIME has been super salty. If you like really salty stuff (my husband does), then go for it. However, I think it's just their generic recipe that's way too salty. I think it's the same chicken that they put on top of all the other dishes so that's salted, then salted noodles, and salty broth.. Ugh. This is the third time I have had the soup specifically. I've complained in the past about it being salty and the manager said they had to follow the recipe set by corporate.. :/\n\nStaff has always been friendly, although a bit spacey. The cashier (young blonde girl) didn't really have any knowledge of the products. The person ahead of us wanted recommendations and the only thing she could say is \"it's good!\" to everything.

They've had a LOT of stores close (mostly the mall-type chain clothing stores in \"The District\") and several restaurants have flipped multiple times (the Irish pub, Cadillac Ranch).  Some places are showing their age already (Dave and Buster's).\n\nOne time my family and I circled the entire place on a Saturday night and there wasn't one single parking space open!  Even Chandler Fashion Center will have some spaces (by Sears, heh).  I am NOT a fan of slapping parking in the middle of a retail center, and prefer surrounding parking garages or even the \"sea of asphalt\" that Chandler Fashion Center has (they were going to build a garage while moving to a more upscale retail mix but that blew up with the recession).  Thankfully, the parking situation near Harkins is pretty simple.\n\nI imagine Tempe Marketplace is nice for locals in the immediate neighborhoods as it gives them big box stores and the movie theater, and they're putting an H\u0026M in to help fix the mass exodus of apparel stores, but between superior super-regional malls (Chandler Fashion Center closer to here for \"normal\" or Scottsdale Fashion Square for selection and luxury) and the plethora of more convenient shopping centers closer to me, I don't personally have a need to ever go here other than when meeting friends.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":1}

She was honest and apologized for forgetting, which I understood those things can happen. BUT when our order came out we were missing a side of sour cream. Our server did come by to check on us til we were two bites away from finishing. (Nor did anyone else walk by or we would've stopped them.) When she finally did stop by again, we declined another round (we were both over it by this point) and told her we were finished. We sat there for literally over 15 mins with my credit card on the table waiting for her to bring the tab. I'm not being over dramatic, we were both looking at our phones constantly, looking at the time. I actually had to get up and go find my server so that we could pay.

I too purchased a Groupon deal, I mean who could pass up a 1 hour massage, 30 min facial and pedicure for $69? I knew it sounded too good to be true..\n\nI first made my appointment for 9/14 and when I came in, I was told my appointment was never on record. I remembered the guy's voice who I had spoken with to make the initial appointment and talked with him about my confusion for the appointment never being on record. He remembered me and offered me 50% off a service. That sounded great until I realized that all of their massages are already 50% off and their prices are the \"lowest in town\". So, I wonder if that's even really a compensation, me thinks not! So, I was pretty much turned away as the receptionist told me he had his staff go on a break since there was no appointment in the books. He said he could try calling them to come back, since I was already there, and I could wait in the media room. I waited a grand total of 5 minutes and then realized it was a waste of my time. Again, I re-scheduled for 9/20. I called on the morning of 9/20 to confirm my appointment and was left recording a voicemail. When nobody returned my call after almost 2 hours, I called back and was greeted with the same male who took my previous appointment. When I called to ask what time my appointment was, he said there was no record of my appointment for that day. He told me it was scheduled for a date in October, which I knew was complete bogus!! At this point, I'm pretty peeved and ask the guy if he remembers me from the previous Friday, how I made the appointment with him IN PERSON...how do they not have it on record?!?! He doesn't even apologize but schedules me for the same day. I don't know if he's just the receptionist or the owner but really feel the business is suffering because of him.\n\nI get to the salon and as I walk in, the male receptionist says he now remembers me. I decide not to give a sly remark back and was left filling out paperwork. From this point on, I would love to give my experience 4 or 5 stars because my massage and facial were great!! The salon is really small and you can hear the chatter from the front of the salon into the massage room so that part wasn't super relaxing. Plus, it was a little warm in the room so that didn't help either. But, my massage therapist was very sweet and professional and gave a great massage! My facial was also very nice and probably the best part of my visit. This was my second time getting a facial ever in my life, the first one being nothing great, so I wasn't expecting much. If I had to come back to this salon, I would definitely return for a facial! I finished my appointment with the pedicure and was really disappointed with the lady who performed the pedicure. She took a couple breaks in between my pedicure (one to talk on the phone and the other to smoke). I was super relaxed at this point from my other services and didn't really care but thought that was unprofessional. The pedicure itself didn't even last 20 minutes...there was no foot or heal scrub and barely a massage...the best things about a pedicure!! I also didn't like the fact the pedicure stands are right when you walk into the salon, again not providing a lot of relaxation. The lady also talked to me about really weird things, including the fact that I had pretty feet and should get paid for people to kiss and hug them...ummm creepy!!\n\nI will say I am glad I used my Groupon and did enjoy the massage and facial. But, I really don't see myself ever stepping foot in here again, even with the 50% off card I recieved. I had trouble finding the place as well, just as a tip, it's right behind the Good Egg restaurant just off baseline and mill ave. Overall, most of the staff were unprofessional, place is very small and trouble with scheduling really put a bad taste in my mouth initially.\n\nI would stay far far away from here...","useful":8,"funny":2,"cool":0}

I no longer live in the area but decided to get an eyebrow wax, as I was in the area. My technician was Blake, who was very informative about the waxing process, but she honestly offended me. In my consultation before the eyebrow wax, she asked if I wanted to get my lip waxed. I said \"no\" and she asked if I've ever had it waxed before. I said yes, once, and the hair grew back darker. She explained how if it's not done right that can happen and advised me not to wax myself. I received the lip wax service at a professional salon and never told her I did it myself at home. She just replied \"oh, well if you want to get your lip waxed, you definitely have plenty of hair for it so just let me know.\" I was so appalled she said that I couldn't comment other than to repeat my previous \"no\" response. The eyebrow wax hurt really badly too, which is pretty unusual as I get regular eyebrow waxes. \n\nAnd, when I went to pay for the service, I noticed their prices increased from $16 to $18 for the eyebrow wax. That definitely didn't sit well either.\n\nI really don't think I will be back. I know technicians have different styles and personalities but even as a salesperson and a technician, I think it's crossing a line to tell someone they have \"plenty of hair\" to get that area waxed.

Yes, there's a Starbucks within a 1 minute walk. \n\nOh, it is only 1 mile from campus and the Stadium, and close to the Phoenix airport. \n\nAloft is not your father's business hotel. It is designed for the younger, hipper, going-on-my-first-years-of-business-trips-crowd. \n\nThe rooms are like a city studio dwelling in design; Euro efficiency in space, trendy decor and colors like that modern furniture store in that trendy city neighborhood you hang out in. \n\nBut be careful, there is no real closet or dresser. Just cubby holes, a curtain to cover your clothes, but no real drawers to hide your drawers!\n\nIf you have friends visiting, hide your unmentionables in your suitcase. Oh, and the door opens right into the bathroom sink, so when you are nude, brushing your teeth after a shower after 8am, try the deadbolt and lock so the maid doesn't walk in on you butt naked!

Aloft is the new younger demo chain for W Hotels, and Elements is almost exactly the same and is the younger., hipper chain for Westin. They are all owned by Starwood hotels, ergo the similarities. \n\nBut don't expect food. They have snacks, like 7 Eleven or Egg McMuffins; and they offer a free hot drink for Gold and Platinum Starwood frequent guests. Big whoop! (They do have a self serve latte machine). They do offer free WI-Fi though, and free parking here. Neon lights on the sides of the building, too. No charge. Haagan Daz for late nite snacks, too. \n\nPricing is reasonable, in the $100 - $150 range, depending on season, location and availability. Most Alofts are in the east.

I've never had Thai Iced Coffee (only Thai Iced tea) so when I saw it on the menu I asked if I could try a small sample of it to see if I liked it. The server said no they don't allow samples, which I thought was kind of rude. Later, she gave me a hard time when I asked to add a little more tea into my Thai Iced Tea because it was way too sweet.\n\nThe complimentary soup was very sweet and had an unusual but pleasant flavor. Presentation of the food was nice and portions were descent. I ordered the red curry lunch special and the abundance of vegetables in the dish were nice. The curry itself was flavorful but not groundbreaking. I think my favorite part of the meal was the complimentary egg roll which was crunch and flavorful. \n\nThe food here was good but not great, and with the lackluster service, I think I'll go back to Thai Elephant before returning here.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

They can give you great recommendations on juices depending on exactly what you're looking for...\n\nWhich brings me to their service. I am so impressed.

In the bowl, there was shredded taco-like lettuce and tomatoes that didn't add much to the flavor. The pita bread was dry and definitely wasn't fresh. Bowl toppings were limited and the kalamata olives added the most flavor. The small side of hummus ($1) wasn't the best and I actually ended up throwing it away.

The buildings are constructed very well and I love the property layout. Despite being so close to the airport (which is very convenient if you plan to have lots of out-of-town visitors like us) we NEVER hear the airplanes inside our apartment. The property is just big enough but also not so large that it feels like a maize. I believe units were originally designed as condos but during the housing market crash they were transformed into apartments - therefore, the floor plans are very well thought out and practical. The provided underground parking garage and security of the complex are also great. You get TWO parking spots (unheard of in most apartment complexes) which is practical if you plan to have two people with cars living in the unit. We moved from a 2200 square foot home out-of-state to a 1480 square foot unit in Camden Sotelo and have not missed our large house once!\n\nYou simply can't beat the location of Camden Sotelo! There's a cute park across the street, a larger park around the corner with a playground and basketball courts, and access to Tempe lake a few blocks away. It's also situated near Papago Mountain/Park, the Phoenix Zoo, and Desert Botanical Gardens. Across the bridge and you're in the heart of downtown Tempe on Mill Street and it's only a 8-10 minute drive to downtown Scottsdale. It's also situated right off of the 202 highway which is very convenient. \n\nWe were nervous that with this property being so close to ASU, it would be filled with students and a college/party zone. Although I'm sure there are some students living here, we haven't had any issues and it seems like most residents are young adults/families.

Who do I turn to? Well Yelp, of course! I've had Honeymoon Sweets bookmarked for a while now and finally had my chance to check them out. \n\nArrived at the small plaza and ironically this little bakery sits next door to a gym - haha! The shop itself is quite small with an ordering counter, one table with two chairs, and a bar with a few stools. It was decorated with school buses, apples, A+'s and other \"back to school\" themed decor - creative and cute! Connected to the shop there is an adjacent formal cake ordering room with several large, lavish wedding cake displays. \n\nMy daughter and I were the only two customers when we arrived and the cashier immediately came out from the back area, greeted us and helped us make our order. I didn't get a chance to try any of their other yummy looking treats as I was determined to get my cupcake fix. Several of the cupcakes were themed in cereal flavors with Fruit Loops or Cinnamon Toast Crunch toppings - to go along with their \"back to school\" theme. I thought that was a cute touch. Since my daughter was with me I had an excuse to order TWO cupcakes (I definitely ate most of both). Tried a spectacular strawberry flavored cupcake and the Cinnamon Toast Crunch cupcake. The cashier mentioned they are better once they are at room temperature but I couldn't wait to eat them. They were good cold too. \n\nAs we were eating our cupcakes in the shop, a few other customers arrived and ordered all sorts of other delicious treats, including personalized cakes. I'd definitely return for another sweets craving!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Service was also good and I appreciated their attention to detail. For instance, the bacon on the burgers is in a circle so that each bite gets bacon. They're also constantly refilling the toppings on the buffet. Homemade root beer was great, but no refills. They offer all the burger toppings you could think of, trash cans throughout, misters if you're sitting outside and need to stay cool, and even a free parking lot - which is pretty unheard of in downtown Tempe. \n\nI'd return because the old western decor and concept are pretty cool.

Seems like they corrected that issue once we told them they must've put the receipts in reverse order.\n\nI tried the vanilla ice cream with strawberry, cacao chips, and hemp granola. The toppings were great but I wasn't at all a fan of the vanilla ice cream. I did hear from someone else the chocolate ice cream tastes way better. \n\nPrices aren't cheap at all so prepare to pay $7-10 for a juice/smoothie. They do use all fresh, natural ingredients so maybe that's worth it for some folks. I may give this place another shot at some point if I'm ever craving a healthy juice/smoothie, only because of it's convenient location within Tempe Marketplace.

Very kind, welcoming staff. The lady at the front desk was attentive and really went out of her way to make me feel special. \n\nOnce you're inside the spa, it is relatively small but inviting. They have a small, private area for showering, restrooms and changing. I believe there was also a small steam room although I didn't go in. If there had been more than 1-2 people in this area at once, it would have definitely felt crowded. Luckily, I was the only one there at the time so it was great. They provide soap, lotion, spray deodorant, mouthwash, towels, robes and slippers. \n\nFirst portion of my spa day consisted of a massage. It was so relaxing and the masseuse had great pressure. I'm glad she didn't make conversation and allowed me to fully relax and enjoy it.  \n\nSecond stop was a facial. This was only my second facial ever and it was way better than the other one I received at another local spa. The esthetician did a great job communicating and answering any of my questions. She gave great light pressure massages on my face and neck throughout. The steam felt nice and the various products she used smelled delightful. Again, this was only my second facial so I am no expert but I'd definitely return here for my next one!\n\nI finished spa day with a pedicure that was fantastic. The nail technician was so friendly and detailed oriented. She did an outstanding job and took her time grooming my feet by scrubbing, exfoliating, applying clay, lotions, special treatments and, of course, a foot massage. Lord knows my feet needed some love. \n\nLight, relaxing music plays in each room. Between each service they provide you with fruit infused water. So refreshing! \n\nThe only reason I'm rating 4 instead of 5 stars is because the spa itself is quite small. It's too bad the architects didn't incorporate any of the beautiful surrounding outdoor space of the hotel - or expand it so that it can comfortably accommodate more people at once.\n\nMy experience was spectacular.

Additionally they only seem to allow you to book appointments online.

Luckily it was a nice day and I had my stroller. Even with an appointment I had to wait about 15-20 minutes which was odd because there was only one other patient waiting in the lobby. \n\nThe phlebotomist herself was very nice and did her best to help my one year old stay as calm as possible for her routine blood work. I was very nervous because this was my daughter's first time getting blood work and she's still so little! They ended up getting another phlebotomist to help me hold her down and keep her still so they'd only have to prick her once. As soon as they finished  they gave her a little sticker and she immediately stopped crying. The phlebotomists did a great job. \n\nI think you can go online to get lab results but you have to enter a bunch of information so I'll just wait for the results from the doctor's office. \n\nOverall not the best experience, then again, getting blood work isn't the most fun, pleasurable experience anyway.

I don't suffer from any pain luckily, the main reason I was drawn to the idea of floating is the detox benefits and the intense relaxation it provides. I am always so stressed out! To be able to go into the float tank, pull the lid down, and float in complete darkness was totally euphoric to me. My body relaxed almost instantly. The soft music that plays at the beginning and end of your session really sent me into a lovely, dreamy coma. To be honest, I was a little disappointed when my session was over. I know a few people have mentioned that they get bored after laying there for an hour.. but I was enjoying it so much that the time flew by for me!\n\nI was a little afraid at first of feeling claustrophobic inside the tank. However, once I got in, I didn't feel that way at all. The tank is quite large, and knowing I could easily open and close the lid was comforting to me. I spent half of my float with the lights off, and then half with them on. I enjoyed watching the gradual shift of colors as the music was playing, it was beautiful.\n\nThe only difficulty I had was trying to keep my mind still and focused on my breathing. I kept thinking about things I had to do later on that day, if I had remembered to feed the dog on my way out, etc. As I was leaving, I explained this to Danny, the sweet and informative counter guy at True REST, and he suggested that when this happens, let the thought in your mind run its course, and then let go of it.  \n\nWhen my session was over, I felt extremely relaxed, almost in a daze. Sitting down and enjoying a cup of tea in the waiting area allowed me to gather myself together so I could drive home safely.  ;)\nI ended up signing up for a membership because I most definitely want to float again. To get all the benefits, you must do it regularly.  \n\nI've been telling all my friends about True REST! I think it's an amazing practice that needs more recognition. If you're considering trying this, please do! You'll be so very glad you did.","useful":7,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We travel with 2 kids (boy and girl) so we always try to book a larger suite. This time they did not make the excuses at the front desk they did last time.  So at least that was a positive.  Another positive the A/C in this room works.  The room is clean and well maintained, which makes the stay nicer.  The grounds and common areas are kept clean and attractive.\n\nCustomer Service - We have been staying for over 20 years at Hilton branded hotels,  70% at Embassy Suites.  I do not know if it is the Phoenix attitude, but at every other Embassy Suites around the country, the front desk recognizes my wife's elite status and welcomes us almost as friends. Most of them even leave a letter from the GM of hotel thanking us for our continued loyalty. Here we are not even acknowledged by the Front Desk as even being hhonors members.  Management needs to do some serious retraining of their Front Desk if they want to keep their Diamond members as return customers.  The best service is by the housekeeping and breakfast staff, who treat everyone as elite hhonors members. Which is how it should be for everyone.  Until the General Manager actually addresses the issues with the front desk this will remain a 3 star hotel in my book.\n\nIf you want to know how an excellent Embassy Suites operates, see my review on the one in Arcadia CA.  \n\nMaybe it is just that in Tempe they get a lot of traffic from ASU and Sky Harbour Airport, they do not feel the need to recognize loyality or choices of guests.  Next trip to Phoenix, we will be looking for a two room suite at a different Hilton Brand, like Squaw Peak or Tapatio Cliffs, where all the customer service is outstanding.  Even a Hampton Inn and Suites provides politer service at check-in. If not needing a suite for kids, the Airport Hilton in Phoenix is a much better, freindlier hotel.\n\nMaybe I am just of the wrong generation, where you were brought being taught that loyalty and customer service are the hallmarks of great establishments versus mediocre ones.   Nicely maintained rooms are to be expected at this brand and if just based on that alone and not the Customer Service we received both times, this would be a 5 star review.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Food is good, but standard bar food so don't expect fine dining.\n\nThe vibe is great though and makes this dive bar worth going to again and again. The live music plays regularly and the bartenders keep your glass (or can depending on what your drinking) full. I think my favorite thing about the bar is the Nintendo decor throughout and the game console hookup near the back room.

You can see my previous five star review below. The plate that we always share, was at least one third smaller than usual, with less rice, less salad, and half as much chicken. The waitress, Loni, was blunt in speech and didn't appear to know how to speak to a customer or resolve any issues. My husband found a long black hair in his mouth, after taking a bite of rice, and when mentioned to Loni, instead of saying sorry she instead asked 'where?' We hadn't asked for a discount or a comp, we just wanted to bring it to her attention. We have ALWAYS had a great experience at Mijana. This time, it felt like all of the newer, under trained employees were running the show and doing a very VERY poor job at it. \n\n\n---previous review---I cannot even believe how delicious this food was! I stumbled across this restaurant on Groupon, wandered in, expecting some sub par Persian and got a five star meal! This food, even being thirty minutes til closing, was FRESH, FLAVORFUL, and absolutely mouthwateringly good. The waitress, Lina, was sweet and professional, as well as informative about the restaurant even though she had only been employees there for a few months. She was a spectacular staff member. Mijana has gotten two new lifelong diners. Very impressed! -on a side note, I got the mixed grill for one and was served tender, juicy kabob meat and kofta with rice and salad.

I guess the only thing that keeps me coming back whenever I happen to be on Mill is the fact that they have a Cider on tap. But unfortunately, that isn't enough to outweigh the negatives. \n\nFirst of all, I am confused by the fact that people can smoke on this patio. I'm not sure how the laws work, but my favorite patios around the city are completely non-smoking and I definitely don't enjoy smoke with my meal. The tables and chairs are not in good shape and the tables are often left a little dirty. The servers aren't very friendly and seem to be rather miserable. On our most recent visit my husband held the door open for one of the staff members who then directed us to \"seat ourselves wherever\" without a thank you or welcome. Kind of weird. The food that we've tried is so-so. I'm not a huge fan of the Irish delicacies, but their veggie sandwich is decent. \n\nI do really like the patio because it's off the main street and hidden in the back. It's a good spot to hang out after an afternoon event at Tempe Town Lake. Rula Bula is by no means a bad place to spend a little time, but with so many better options around the city I don't know if I'll return.","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":3}

After he completed the work, he said the cost was $150, but that he didn't have an invoice on him.  A few weeks later, I got an invoice in the mail for $150.  I called a few weeks later and paid it over the phone with a credit card.  Then a month later (so now two months after the service was completed), I got a bill from Old Republic saying I owe an additional $65 for the service fee.  I informed them it was a misunderstanding and that I already paid Aaron Pools directly what I owed them.  I held on the line while they called Aaron Pools and the office manager flat out LIED to them.  She told them she sent the tech to see what was wrong, that he figured out the part he needed and then returned to install it - claiming we owed $65 for the first visit and $150 for the second visit an hour later.  So then I told Old Republic that I would call and refresh her memory of our conversation that I remembered word for word.  The Aaron Pools office manager was very rude and defensive and told me I was wrong and that I owe the additional money.  I learned that what I thought was an honest mistake was actually INTENTIONAL!  Aaron Pools sent me an invoice and waited for me to pay i and then sent Old Republic an invoice for the same thing!  I have learned my lesson... DON'T trust anyone!  Get EVERYTHING in writing.  Sadly, people with integrity are few and far between these days.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Don't blush darling. Our love will not remain in the shadows! \n\nDo you remember the time that you almost tried to set my boyfriend on fire? You put on an amazing little impromptu firework show when your misters got into a fight with that pesky string of lights, but you were kind enough to quell our fear and try to erase that memory with free alcohol, you wily little minx. You needn't delete him from the equation. We're usually game for a three way with you, Mistress Gusto.\n\nThat was right when the two happiest hours in my otherwise hellacious day were coming to an end. You do know that between the hours of four and six, your warm embrace and sweet nectar are all I need to forget about the dramarama of the office. The memories of your hibiscus, tamarind and mango margaritas, frosty Dos XXs and generous glasses of sauvignon blanc bring a smile to my face, especially with a three dollar price tag.\n\nAnd you're always very gracious when I graze freely on the chips and salsa when I'm feeling frugal. I don't know what combination of chili and spices you sprinkle on your toasty little delights, but they're positively divine. Although they can't even hold a candle to your tasty salsa.\n\nTo help keep me from acting like a lush, which would greatly embarrass me in your presence, you offer half price appetizers during happy hour. That guacamole of yours with the pomegranate seeds has a zesty twist, while your gigantic Mexican pizza and mountainous machaca nacho plate have lured large groups of my friends to your patio and bar on many an occasion. Sharing is caring, and you're trying to teach the world to be a better place, one shrimp cocktail at a time. \n\nWhen I'm feeling like a nice lunch or dinner instead of our usual rendezvous, your pozole always brings me happiness, with snow white hominy afloat in a sea of green and lots of tortillas to sop up that goodness. Your Colorado Stew is likewise as delectable, as are the Mexican street tacos. I especially dig how you let me mix and match three tacos, so I can add a red chili pork taco and fried fish taco into the mix!\n\nYour cute little bistro setting with the beaded lamps and cushy bench seating made a delightful setting for a first date, while your exemplary menu, service and specials has had me coming back ever since. It's a good thing I'm not the jealous type, because I want to share you with all of Tempe.","useful":10,"funny":11,"cool":11}

Giant rectangles of squeaky ham squares marbled with big visible veins of fat should have been a cut to a quarter of that size (and wouldn't hurt to order up from your meat dealer, because when you buy low the taste reflects that). Meatballs tasted old with an odd mealy texture and metallic tang that dominated the flavors and left a terrible lingering aftertaste. Sausage rounds were forgettable. Pepperoni was okay but flabby and not crispy, like everything on the pizza. And it's not because the toppings were packed to tight, that's for sure. Weird crust too, bland and floury with zero flavor and no rise. Despite the flabby toppings and cheap cheese, the crust was somehow burned too? All for the low, low price of $17!\n\nGot an antipasto salad too with the house dressing, couple handfuls of romaine lettuce for $6 with salami, more awful ham I discarded, pepperoni, provolone, and onions. Again everything was chopped way too big. Don't get the house dressing either.

To remind them of their stay in my land of delight, I'll let them redeem tickets for cheap-o trinkets with the name of my wonderland plastered all over 'em. I'd be the kind of mayor that brings back the nip of scotch with my loyal sycophants on a lazy afternoon and I'd give teenage hooligans the boot, telling them to go frolick in Tilly's or Charlotte Russe because my electric wonderland is a den of iniquity and requires a chaperone over 25 for anyone under the age of 18. \n\nToo keep the masses happy I'd offer a massive feast at reasonable prices, with appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, burgers, ribs, seafood, pasta, chicken, steaks and sweet, sweet desserts. And to make them feel like they're getting their money's worth, maybe I'll create little indulgences like happy hours and meal deals. Between 4:30 and 7:00 Monday through Friday I'll let my lovely little bunnies indulge in cheap drinks and offer a Power Hour game card for ten bucks that allows all the game play their little hearts desire for a whole hour! And maybe I'll even offer a reverse happy hour from 10:00 to close Sunday through Thursday... Yeah, that's a great idea, and I'll make my closing hours midnight Sunday through Thursday and one in the morning on Friday and Saturday! Now, meal deals, meal deals, how about an Eat and Play combo? It would consist of 25 meals and a ten dollar game card for $15.99, and I'd give them the option of adding an extra ten bucks to their game card for an even 25 bucks. Now I'd be a generous mayor, but I still have to pay for the infrastructure somehow, so I'd have to put a time limit on this awesome deal. Let's say Sunday through Thursday from open to close and until 5 in the evening on Friday and Saturday.\n\nAnd I'll sneak in a $2.00 activation fee for all new cards (except those with my mega meal deal), but to sweeten the blow I'll let my followers retain their cards to recharge them in the future, fee free! And I'll let 'em accumulate their ticket count over time to keep them coming back for more, more, MORE!\n\nAs mayor I will create a land where divorced dads with their kiddos, young couples looking for some goofy fun and video game nerds can coexist, with a happy beer buzz and over stimulated pupils the size of dinner plates due to my flashing lights, whirling colors and jaunty winning noises. It'll be like a casino, but it won't be a place where dreams go to die. Saturdays will be the most crowded, but will still be manageable in size, as the mob ebbs and flows between midway and video games. There will be skee ball, air hockey, basketball free throw games, streaming water races, those games where the horse runs fast when you roll little balls into holes, virtual bowling, wacky drop the coin games, old skool Pac Man, Donkey Kong and Space Invaders, House of the Dead, motorcycle and racecar games, virtual boxing and my personal favorite, Super Trivia, where six people match wits against one another and get hundreds of tickets if they're super suave like me! Then they can trade those tickets in for junk like nose hair trimmers in the shape of a finger, t-shirts with our emblem on it, Chinese finger traps and jumbo pixie sticks!\n\nOoo, ooo, and there will be fun little shots in those bottom heavy hourglass-shaped shot glasses where the mixer goes in the bottom and the shot goes in the top. And I'll even let 'em keep the shot glass, class act that I am. I can see it now, my own personal funland...\n\nWhat? Dave and Buster's already snaked my idea? Those sneaky fucking bastards. I guess I'll just have to go there if I'm feeling the need for a little goofy fun.\n\nEdit: By no means order anything that can't be produced by the divest of dive bars' short order cook.

You deserve an incredible amount of credit for that. \n\nMy question for you is: do they all have to taste assy?\n\nI mean, I know some people like the taste of your Arizona Peach ale, but the last time I tried it I did something uncharacteristic. I didn't even finish the whole thing. It smelled like country time heaven, but it tasted like fetid peach bile. Your IPA, Hop Knot, and Oatmeal Stout give me bitter beer face, but since they're supposed to have strong character and flavor, I accept this inevitability and leave them to someone who will love them with all the passion they deserve. And it seems like your Kiltlifter exists only to get me plowed in record time, at about 6% alcohol by volume, so that's a good thing and means it's bound to be strong like a bull, so I can accept the ass factor. \n\nWhen it boils down to it, the only beers you have on tap that seem fit for my consumption are the 8th Street Ale and the Hefewiezen. But even those leave me with a hang over the next morning. \n\nDid I do something wrong? Is that why you don't like me? Is that why you feel it necessary to have your beer drill its way into my skull and leave me with a headache the morning after, regardless of the fact that the fancy imports and run of the mill domestic beers I consume at other bars don't even cause me to blink an eye? I thought we had a pretty solid relationship, but since I haven't been visiting you that often, I guess you've had a change of heart.\n\nSo I'll make a concerted effort to swing by for happy hour every now and then to share a pitcher between 3 and 7, but only when somebody else suggests we visit. You just seem to slip through the cracks whenever my little barfly mind starts thinking up fun places to enjoy a couple brews after work. (Luckily that isn't the case when my grumbling stomach does the talking, because your food is delicious and would be a terrible thing to miss out on!)\n\nI think it may also have something to do with your patio, which is unwelcoming and a freakin' madhouse at all times of the day. Provided I can get one, those gigantic square tables only let me chat with the people to either side of me. And I'm practically sitting in the lap of the people behind me, causing me to maneuver like a slinky snake just to get out of my chair and weasel my way to the restroom. Doesn't this piss off your servers? Because I'd be pissed off if my job was to pick my way through that maze on a regular basis. Maybe that's why sometimes I get poor service on the patio, because your indoor and side car dining areas have always had the most attentive ladies waiting on me. I guess I have a serious love hate thing going on with your patio, Peaks.\n\nGranted, the food you offer is phenomenal, especially for a place that calls itself a brewery. You have gone above and beyond the basic need for chex mix and peanuts on the bar, or fried greasy food that's on par with bowling alley eats. You offer some amazing and delicious dishes. \n\nOne of my favorites is your Southwest Burger with pepper jack cheese and green chili that is positively rockin' with flavor, but the sweet jalapeno dressing tastes a little meh, so I get it on the side when I'm a little iffy about the funk factor of my burger. \n\nYou do have one stand out menu item that everyone should bow down to though, and that is the Grilled Chicken Beer Bread. It is a soft pillowy tribute to chickens everywhere. If they could speak...well they'd berate you for eating them, so we'll consider it a posthumous tribute. Or perhaps it's a tribute to the amazing artichokes and peppers. And the sauce drizzled in this dish is the perfect accompaniment.\n\nAlso, your beer battered fries are off the hook good.\n\nSo at least you've got that going for you. \n\nI'll be seeing you around Peaks. I just won't be singing your praises on a regular basis.\n\nCheers!\nErica","useful":6,"funny":11,"cool":8}

Pete's Fish and Chips was thrown around as an option, but she decided on Joe's Crab Shack. Seeing how it's her day for a super happy birthday extravaganza of fun, I conceded. And all I have to report on the experience is coupled with a shrug and an, \"Eh.\"\n\nIf you like the corporate atmosphere of TGI Fridays or Bennigan's or any of those other places where they put shit on the walls, you'll probably enjoy Joe's Crab Shack. You'll be prepared for the pitfalls as well. It's overpriced and under-seasoned. It's dried out when fried up. It's unoriginal and bland. But if you douse everything with malt vinegar and tartar sauce, I contend that even cardboard would go down smooth.\n\nI've been here several times on others' bill, and have left with the same lackluster impression and a belly full of grease. I've had the combos, fried and grilled, the crab sandwich, the fish and chips and the crab dip, and I really can't even rank them in order of best to worst because nothing stands out as stellar or atrocious. It's all just...there.\n\nPlus their margaritas are weak. \n\nEh.","useful":6,"funny":7,"cool":2}

But if you want to learn a new curse word or two to awe your peers on the playground, keep reading. Who am I kidding? Kids don't read any more. There aren't enough flashy graphics on this page to keep the interest of those ADHD spider monkeys. So with that in mind...\n\nI don't usually write reviews about chain establishments, but I've got a big glass of hater-ade (venti nonfat whothefuckknows) at my side this morning and I just gotta unleash the fury before it implodes and consumes me. \n\nAhem.\n\nFuck Starbucks.\n\nFuck them and the flea ridden ass they trotted in on. \n\nBy some twist of fate, probably engineered by Loki, I ended up with forty dollars in gift cards to this black hole of mass consumerism and corporate greed. But far be it from me to let free money go to waste, so I've been dashing in the past few days to burn these credits as fast as plastic trees can burn. The past three visits have reinforced everything I've come to know and hate about this piss poor chain of mediocre, overpriced coffee, distilling my hatred into a seething mass of vile, putrid ichors that have accumulated somewhere in the region of my appendix. I'm in a dark, dark place right now folks.\n\nFuck the pretentious pidgin Italian that's the closest suburban soccer moms are ever going to get to that European vacation. Tall? Venti? Grande?

Open up wide because they're about to unload right into your willing and waiting mouth, and you're going to pay them to do it.\n\nFuck the people that order a grande half-caf nonfat pumpkin spice cappuccino, dry, extra hot, two pumps white chocolate, one pump sugarfree hazelnut. Translation: You're an asshat and I'm late for work, so get your five hundred calorie monstrosity out of my fucking way before I \"accidentally\" knock it all over your god damn pumps, you frigid bitch. The amount of time it takes you to order your drink at Starbucks is proportionate to what a demanding, micromanaging cuntbucket you must be in real life. It's fucking coffee. Like fucking Taco Bell, there are only so many ingredients they can mix and match to create new and zany combinations. Add espresso, cut with a mixer, add syrup. Presto chango. You have an eight dollar cup of joe.\n\nFuck the people that hang out at Starbucks too. This morning the fucking place was packed wall to wall with affluent suburbanites in their business casual reading newspapers, playing on their laptops and sipping shitty coffee. You've gotta have some place better to be. No? Really? Your life is so dull and predictable that Starbucks is the hippest most happening place you can think of to waste an extra half an hour of prime snooze time? You know what, I can't even rip on you. That's depressing. You're spiraling downward in a haze of bitter java, suffocated by the oppressive blanket of corporate familiarity and clonelike oneness. I'll let you reside in your little coffee coffin a bit longer, free of ridicule. Unless you're the bastard with a ten part order. Then the gloves come back off. \n\nAnd fuck the stale baked goods and prepackaged luncheon fare at Starbucks. I had a bagel. It was hard as a rock and dryer than your mom's...I'm gonna censor that one. I had an overpriced fruit and cheese plate. Mealy apples and cheddar atop a bed of lettuce, with a wedge of brie to show you they're 'gourmet.' Suckfest. Breakfast sandwiches that I'm sure must have been display models because they bared an eerie resemblance to rubber, cardboard and sawdust. Industrial, mmm. I've also had the donuts. How on earth do you fuck up a donut?! Somehow they managed. Sensing a trend here? Cuz I'm just about beating you over the head with it. Everything offered at Starbucks is the same shit you can get at Circle K for half the price, except it's wrapped in a shiny plastic package and distributed en masse to the overweight gullets of Americans everywhere.\n\nKnow what the kicker is? \n\nI had to manually add this location. \n\nFive fucking pages of Starbucks locations in the Greater Phoenix Metro Area and I had to go and add another. \n\nSo fuck Starbucks.","useful":10,"funny":38,"cool":15}

The first night our party of six were enjoying our pizzas when I casually mentioned that we'd ordered one pizza without mushrooms and some had found their way unto it.  Within a a couple of minutes the manager was at our table with an apology and an offer to comp a couple of deserts.  Geez, it was just an errant mushroom!  In fact, the pizza here is very good and they clearly go the extra mile in trying to accommodate their customers.\nI was please enough to return the next night with my wife and share a Margarita pizza (which is very good).  Wanting something sweet to finish off our meal, we opted for the chocolate mousse.  While it may not have been the ultimate dessert it was quite good and we enjoyed several bites before deciding we'd had enough to satisfy without adding unnecessarily to our growing waistlines.  Seeing we'd only eaten a bit, the waitress comped the dessert.  We explained we'd been happy with the mousse and were just full but she took it off the bill just the same.  \nNow, there are a lot of choices where to eat and a whole lot of pizza joints, but for my money a little extra courtesy goes a long way.

I imagine those reviews were \"bought\" somehow. I went here after work today and had a terrible experience. I wanted about an inch off (I had very long hair) and now it is above my shoulder with sloppy layers (some so short they are probably 2 1/2 inches in length). I will own up to my own error in this, as I agreed to a shorter cut but NOT this short as I explicitly said below the shoulder and was very reluctant about the layers.\n\nFurthermore, I've always been outspoken about what I call \"hair salon bullying\". This is a hair stylist belittling your current style/color in order to sell you a color or cut they envision for you (and potentially so they can make more $). \"What is that crazy bleach job you have going on?\" \"So the last person who cut your hair, they obviously didn't know what they were doing, did they?\" My stylist did all of the above, making me feel like, \"Oh nice, so you're telling me I've been walking around looking like sh*t the last few months...\" It puts me in a vulnerable place and I want to hear the professional's opinion. \n\nHowever, that said, I took her advice and went shorter than I planned but it still did not come out as promised which was supposed to be longer than shoulder length. And the layers are so inconsistent, choppy, and poorly done that a friend asked me if I had a mullet in the front. Just horrible. Stay away!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Be sure to use sun-screen!\n\nIf you are visiting from out of state please be aware that the walkways have lots of cactus with thousands of razor sharp needles right next to the walkways, there is plentiful wildlife (lizards, rodent things, lots of birds, and insects galore) and during the day it gets really really hot and dry.

The restaurant is located in the central core of the Tempe Marketplace, sort of in the south-east corner, near the  Harkin's Theater complex. Plenty of parking, easy walk to the front door, the restaurant is near the parking area, near Jimmy John's.\n\nThe menu is large, so be sure to decide what to order before you go. The 'regular' size bowls are rather large, so are the portions. The small soup bowls are very small, like elementary school size.\n\nKeep in mind, the place is called 'Noodles' any entree you order, the primary ingredient will be pasta, not the meat toppings. We tried the Steak Stroganoff and the Alfredo MontAmore. On both dishes, the sauces and meats were sparse but excellent. We'd both order them again. These are not sugary.\n\nTwo others in our group also ordered the Wisconsin Cheesesteak and BBQ Pork sandwiches. Both come from the kitchen much much smaller than the photos online. The meat for the Cheeststeak was the same as the Steak Stroganoff. My friend with the Cheesesteak said he'd never order one again. It was juicy and tender but kind of boring. \n\nThe BBQ Pork was topped with coleslaw. The BBQ Pork Sub was described as bland, should probably be re-named Coleslaw Sub with traces of pork.\n\nBoth sandwiches came with sides, both got Tomato Basil, both liked that soup but said it was not worth going out to eat.\n\nProcess: You order at the counter, sit at a table inside or outside with a numbered sign waiting for food to be delivered to the table. For carry out (you can order online or by phone) stay near the register and listen for your name to get called. With four meals, my time from turning off the Loop 101 to returning to the Loop 101 was about half an hour.\n\nIf you are a sugary food fan, like a person who thinks Panda Express is the best, you will probably not like Noodles \u0026 Company. \n\nIf you get carry-out be mindful of soups in bowls potentially leaking, after you get to the car make sure they're sitting upright in the bag.\n\nSummary: sandwiches were disappointing but noodle based entrees were filling and well made. This is not a fast food restaurant, it's more like a fast-casual restaurant. This is the first Noodles store in Arizona.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":3}

To make matters worse I ordered a lemonade I could not avoid that damn lemon! \n\nDespite not enjoying the lamb's tongue everything else is quite delicious.

For example, you can get a feta cheese pizza for the same price as a pepperoni.

Their selection of beers isn't staggering or anything, but the food there is actually pretty damn decent and they have a fair number of appetizers to choose from that aren't too heavy.\n\nLike I said, sometimes I've been here on days where it's totally bullshit.  I remember I came here once with my girlfriend at the time and we literally didn't get served for about thirty minutes.  I would've bailed but it was her first time there so I was like, \"We're gonna do this shit.\"  The same waitress who took her sweet-ass time spent maybe like three seconds talking to and then on her way to get our beers, she stopped at a table with these dudes with British accents and giggled and slapped her knee and sat there for like maybe five minutes.  I was like, \"Oh, great... our waitress is a whore for accents and two dudes with British accents are here.  We're fucked.\"  Yes, I admit, the English are quite charming, quite, but sonofabitch, man. \n\nFor like the longest time, that waitress would always be there when I was there and no matter where I sat, it was her section.  And there she was, takin' forever and lookin' mad at me.  Haven't seen her there in forever so I've lucked out.\n\nYou know, it's easy to complain, but most often I've had a really good time.

They are the people who know bikes.  You think you know bikes?  You don't know shit.  These guys know what they're doing.  But, when you take your bike in to have little metal piece on your bicycle seat fixed, they'll fuck it up even worse than what you had it before and shrug it off with an attitude that says, \"Well, shit, you should've bought the $600 seat if you wanted me to fix it up.  My fingers were made for the finest gold.\"\n\nTempe Bicycle throws that pretense out the window.  They are incredibly professional and courteous even when they're busy beyond belief.  When you come in and you need to have them fix something they will deal it to you straight without suggesting that in order to be a true bicyclist, you need to dress like a fucking clown and mount up on a bike that costs more than a car.\n\nEven non-profit organizations can leave you groaning sometimes the way they treat everyone indifferently, but Tempe Bicycle, specifically this location (not so much the other one), they will get your job done very well.  Just recently I had them put some grips on my bike using their air gun, squirt some air into my tires and lube up the chain and they did it for free even after I offered to throw like five or ten bucks their way.\n\nVery professional and courteous.","useful":7,"funny":11,"cool":4}

My food came quick and I made it to the movie like right in the nick of time.  It was awesome.\n\nService was awesome.  At first, it was a little surreal, because the hostess, like, went on this long, \"How to order...\" monologue and I zoned out because, man, I know how to order food.  I'm kind of a hick sometimes but I know how to order food.  Shit.  I didn't pay attention to her at all.  \n\nBasically, you build your own burger.  Fries aren't included.  Got it.  I built my own burger and it was pretty bomb.  I ordered one of about thirty TRILLION different kind of milkshakes they have.  That milkshake brought me close to orgasm.  \n\nThe food was great.  The service was super awesome.  Considering how hectic and busy it was, it was great.  There was a mix up and I only got half an order on my milkshake, but I never would have known unless my waitress told me because it was already pretty huge.  She said she'd bring me the other half but I was like, \"Nah, this is already bordering gluttony.\"\n\nIf I'm in the neighborhood I'll pop in again.","useful":4,"funny":4,"cool":3}

It's a relic.  A dinosaur of a building.  If you know me, you know I love dinosaurs.  Since the building is old, they did with it what they could, and I enjoy the hectic, \"Where the hell is the bathroom?\" feeling you get.  Without fail, for some reason, whenever I go to Monti's, I feel stoned.  I think it's because rooms and different sections are placed so randomly throughout the building, I feel like I'm waltzing through M.C. Escher's imagining of a 4th-dimension steakhouse.\n\nIt's not the best steak in town, but it's good and you get two sides.  If you get a potato, they will bring you a goddamn potato.  The sides are big and the bread that they start you off with is pretty tasty.  I'm a sucker for rosemary.\n\nI like that it's dark, I like that the building is so old you can imagine someone, 150 years ago, getting shot in the throat over the last bite of steak.","useful":4,"funny":3,"cool":3}

I've had some negative experiences a few years ago, but nothing like that has happened since.  There used to be this air of snootiness with some of the cashiers, but I haven't encountered anything like that in a long time.  It was especially the case when trying to sell DVD's.  I was broke as shit and needed to sell off some movies and the dude I was dealing with told me a special features disc on a box-set I had was damaged, so I couldn't sell it as a box set and I got less money.  I watched the special features, like, ONCE and I take really good care of all of my DVD's, so what's the fucking deal?  I think they did it so that they could sell the movies individually and make more of a profit as they'd be easier to sell.  I know that's a ballsy claim, but look at my DVD collection.  Spotless.  \n\nIt also used to be that your collection of music or movies would be scoffed at.  Don't scoff at me, motherfucker!  My taste rocks the shit, it's your taste that sucks, Mr. Avant-Garde-I-Only-Watch-Fellini-Followed-up-by-Jodorowsky.  If I want to be scoffed at, I'll try to sell Wal-Mart jeans to Buffalo Exchange.  Anyway, like I said, nothing like that has happened in a long time, so it's a lot more pleasant, less snooty.  \n\nJust so you know, this is not a place to buy new movies.  Their new releases are outrageously overpriced.  I've seen some Hollywood mainstream fare selling for like thirty bucks, when I know damn well at Best Buy it's probably going for like twenty at most.  Anyway, whatever, this is a place for used movies.  \n\nIn reference to their movie selection, they don't have a lot of classic movies.  I couldn't find The Wild Bunch, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre or Night of the Hunter.  Depending on who sells what, some pretty decent shit will roll in.  It took about five visits, but they finally had Trainspotting and I snatched it up but quick.\n\nWhen it comes to music, they've had just about everything that I wanted.  It's easy and I've always gotten what I wanted from various musicians.  I'm not a big music geek, so I've never looked for anything too obscure.  I'm a movie geek.  I can't be both, I don't have the time for two obsessions, but I do love my music.  \n\nThey have what I want, which may or may not satisfy your needs as a music geek.  They have T. Rex on vinyl for cheap.  I've seen some Tom Waits on vinyl.  Basically any artist I enjoy, they'll have their CD.  It does the job.\n\nOne major complaint:  Every time I go to Zia, there's always, ALWAYS some goober who is standing so as to block an entire aisle and won't move his ass.  I don't like saying, \"Excuse me,\" I think you should just know better and kindly move the fuck out of my way.  I know it's not Zia's fault, but goddamnit... every fucking time.","useful":2,"funny":4,"cool":3}

The reason being, their slogan is, \"Where the only thing fried is the occasional customer,\" and they toss other puns around like \"toasted.\"  I don't think anyone's referenced someone as being \"totally fried\" or \"toasted\" for a good 25 years or so.  Their interpretation of stoner culture is very much whitewashed and made fun for the whole family.\n\nThe ambience is not very pleasant if you are, in actuality, stoned.  They usually blast heavy metal really loud.  Even worse, it's a heavy metal radio station so you also get to hear idiotic radio banter.

As a shopping center, it's not too convenient because you pretty much have to drive everywhere within the center.  The Target is a 10 minute walk from the movies and the Best Buy is a 15 minute walk from the BevMo.  I'm not lazy-ass (okay, I am, but not when it comes to walking), but this is a shopping center, a \"marketplace\" if you will, things should be a stone's throw from each other.  Considering how the place is laid out, if you do this enough times on foot, you're bound to get hit by a car.  You're going to be like, \"Yay, I bought Mario Galaxy 2, now I'm going to get a bottle of--BOOM!!\" and you're dead.  \n\n2.  I ride my bike everywhere and, yeah, like I said earlier, I'm terrified of getting smacked by a car.  There are no bike lanes and sidewalks that end randomly.\n\n3.  Got my bike light stolen there once and I held a grudge.\n\n4.  The place reeks of Axe Bodyspray.  \n\nThere are, however, benefits to it:\n\n1.  It's not trashy.  As lame as it sounds, this is really important sometimes.  Sometimes trashy things are delightfully fun, but when trashiness is not applied correctly it can end with terrible things happening (tweekers stripping down naked and crying).  Tempe Marketplace is definitely the kind of place that wouldn't know how to do trashy correctly, they'd end up having some redneck bar where people constantly homophobic things.  Sometimes I appreciate a place where I can bring my mom without having to explain what some graffitied wall said.  \"Mom, it's when a man and a man love each other very much....\"\n\n2.  Most places there to plug your gut are at least pretty okay.  No McDonald's, nothing like that.  Most places you stop into have a pretty decent spread with a bar and you can eat pretty well.  I like that.\n\n3.  The combination of having a movie theater and a Dave and Busters is a great one.  You can have a few shots and beers, shoot some zombies in the face and then watch whatever stupid action movie is playing this Summer.\n\n4.  Plenty of bike racks.

My eyes must have gone black because they ended up putting me in a bigger truck for the same price.  \n\nThis Scottsdale Rd. location, they were very nice and I appreciate the ride, but really, they didn't seem to give two shits that I had placed a reservation and even checked in online.  What exactly did I check into?  A ghost truck?  Some sort of phantom?  They never offered to call another location for me to check availability so when they dropped me off, there was no way of telling how many prior reservations had been booked so it's totally possible they could have dropped me off and there could have been absolutely 0 truck that I was able to take off in.\n\nIt was a hassle but some other location ended up coming through for me.  In the future, I now know that reserving a truck does not mean I'll end up getting anything from these guys other than a head-ache.  I'm probably just going to book in advance with the larger location on McClintock to avoid a hassle.","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":1}

This was hands down the worst Los Favs I've ever been to and let me explain why... \nSo for starters I went to get a drink and wait for my ride which took about 20 minutes and I wanted to pass time so I went to claw machine. I got there and a bear was dangling off the claw so I was happy and put a dollar into the machine for two turns and played. It didn't fall after repeatedly hitting the side and I never got my second try. I went and asked for 50 cents for the second try and one of the workers rudely told me they don't have the keys for the machine, I understood because they never saw me put a dollar in and I get it so I asked for change for a 20 and she told she only had a dollar in her drawer and pulled the last dollar to show me. Right after I asked for the change she took the tip money from my view and went to the back and came back with a empty jar assuming I was going to steal the money! I sat down and kept drinking my lemonade still waiting for my ride and two customers after that whole tip money incident had a 20 and she gave him change from the second drawer. This highly upset me, and I felt like I wasn't treated equally. After this she threatened me that if I don't order food that she will call the cops on me. So I told her she can call, for the fact that I did nothing wrong. A few minutes later she changes her story and said she's calling her manager instead! So my ride came and told me to get them a bean burrito so I go up the counter because not only did I want to order I wanted to get this rude and unfair workers name. Before I can even walk up to the counter to order she took off her name tag and put it in her pocket! She refused to give me her or her managers name. If she didn't want me knowing her name, she shouldn't treat customers so disrespectfully. While I was at the counter trying to order she didn't want to take me as a serious paying customers and insisted that the customers in back of me go in front of me! Not the way the business should be runned. Stay away from this Los Favs! \n\nI'm not trying to be the bad guy here, I just don't think this is how a business should handle their customers.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":0}

First off, props to all the female workers in the back kitchen putting out great food. We had the pani puri, samosa chaat, dhokla, methi paratha, and choley bhatura. The pani puri was super flavorful, though the pani was really spicy. If you like spice, you'll love it! The samosa chaat was also really well made and quite well balanced in terms of flavor. I didn't personally get to taste the dhokla, but my friend seemed to love it. Choley bhatura came with two giant bhaturas and a good portion of choley on the side. It was very filling in terms of portion and tasted pretty good overall. Now, you should know that they make their methi parathas by hand. They were just so tasty! The methi paratha came with a side of pickle and yogurt.\n\nI have to admit I was super confused about how to order when I first walked in. You essentially go pick up a blue slip located next to the water and mark what you would like to order. Then you give the slip to someone in the back kitchen and they will bring your food out. After you're done eating, you go and pay at the front. The women in the back kitchen were very nice and really accommodating about our orders. I can't really comment on the owner at the front because he just rang our bill up without ever saying anything.\n\nOverall, this place has GREAT food and is definitely the place to go for Indian dishes.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

I ordered it in ivory because the salesman said he'd had the very same set for years and that it was still in perfect shape. He said it was not only dirt resistant, but very durable. Also, I sprung for the warranty after he said that if any marks showed up on the upholstery, they would take care of it. \n\nWhen the furniture arrived, all was great except the ottoman is a completely different fabric quality. What's supposed to be a sturdy linen/tweed fabric was more like a thin cotton. It had/has zero durability. When it arrived it already looked old and worn out.\n\nI called right away. They sent out a gentleman three weeks later who said, yep, looks pretty bad. In fact, by the time he got there three weeks later, the sofa and chair were already starting to look worn out too. Not just dirt - the cushions are lumpy and the fabric was already pilling and wearing after just three weeks.\n\nAgain, the gentleman said it didn't look right to him and that he would speak to the owner. Nothing ever happened. I called three times. Nothing. I finally went into the store in person and spoke with the original salesman, who was nice and said he would speak to someone and have them call me the next day. No call. I called a few days later and he said whoops, someone will call you tomorrow. Never happened.\n\nFinally the owner took my call and was frankly rude.\n\nHe sent the same gentleman back out to look at my furniture who again said, yep this looks terrible. The quality on this furniture is horrendous. I'm a shoes-off, very clean household, and mop every day and have had white furniture before without a problem.\n\nThis isn't just color and a bit of dirt, this is fabric quality. The gentleman said he'd speak with the owner and get back to me straight away.\n\nWe settled on me asking for professional cleaning, I'd arrange to have the furniture scotch-guarded (it wasn't, despite Dante telling me this thing is dirt resistant and durable), and I requested a replacement ottoman. He apologized and said he'd ask someone to get back to me right away.\n\nIt's been TEN days. Nothing. Never, ever, ever will I shop here again. This is not just terrible furniture quality (I'm actually embarrassed by my furniture now that's only 5 months old) this customer service is terrible. The ottoman is ready for Goodwill, though I doubt anyone would want it.\n\nI should also mention that when I told the technician that the salesman said it was dirt resistant and of sturdy quality to last ten years, the tech said, \"Well he's trying to sell you something. What did you expect him to say.\"","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":0}

I suspect both will be posting reviews here soon.  I've cut my losses \u0026 listed both houses for sale after struggling to make repairs...the move out inspections conducted by AZP did not assist me in preparing either home for listing!  When I told Kirsten I had another realtor to list the homes, things got icy....and I guess we broke up; she dumped me!\n   After several attempts to get a good status on both homes, I was shuffled off to a customer service person to \"handle\" me so Kirsten \u0026 company could avoid me.  Avoid me she did; I no longer got responses to phone calls, texts, emails, or portal requests for info.  At one point, I was passed off to a man at AZ Home Renovations, a contractor hired by AZP.  He was the \"fixer\", the guy whose job it was to answer work orders \u0026 get repair people out to take care of issues so AZP could wash their hands of me.  As much as I enjoyed his personality, his subcontractors were sub-par, \u0026 most repairs had to be re-accomplished 2 or even 3 times...we just received another call tonight from our realtor that 2 repairs that we've already paid for were never accomplished.  I'm exhausted.  If I could recoup the time \u0026 energy devoted to follow up \u0026 blocking their blame-shifting \u0026 excuse making, I'd take a vacation.  Of course I'm out thousands...so the vacation funds are lacking.  \nHouse #1: Tenants gave notice that they would NOT renew lease, then AZP failed to collect rent for the last month until I spurred them 3x to do so.  House was vacated, inspection was conducted by AZP \u0026 I received little to no info about the results, and had to repeatedly ask them for an assessment of damages \u0026 their professional judgement of what damages the tenants would be responsible for from their deposit.  Professional judgment has been lacking here, so I should have just hired someone to inspect on my behalf, but I DID pay a management fee for that month, so this service was paid for.  Eventually I hired someone to go inspect, and they took pictures \u0026 made a list of obvious damages that had been overlooked by the \"professionals\".  Examples: several windows were unable to be locked due to frame damage/house shifting (house could not be secured), broken window, front door handle was broken, broken blinds, grass in back yard was destroyed from a storage shed placed in center of yard, water damage under dishwasher, carpets were not cleaned \u0026 had stains (these were BRAND new), bath tub was not cleaned, all smoke detectors were inop, gate to backyard pool area was no longer self closing (code requirement), \u0026  a few other minor write-ups.  \nHouse #2: After not getting an answer from AZP about the tenant's intent to renew, I got their contact info \u0026 called the tenants directly.  The were so upset \u0026 frustrated with AZP; they decided they could not salvage the relationship \u0026 stay in the house, and they expressed that had I fired them a year ago, they would have been much happier \u0026 would have stayed.  They said Kim was so cold \u0026 rude, that it gave them anxiety to address work orders even when they needed to follow up on repairs.  They had been paying to fix minor problems on their own purely to avoid the conflict \u0026 stress of AZP employees.\nSome of the issues: the landscaper AZP hired had taken the winter off but still billed \u0026 was paid (from my rent $) by AZP, so we had LOTS of catch up work to do to get things under control.  I asked to be reimbursed the months of fees I had paid when no service was provided; they ignored this request with a \"let's see what we can do to make it right\", then silence.  I emailed 3x to give \"last call\" to resolve, then I gave up.  The move out inspection for this house was better, but the very nice tenants had taken good care of the place, \u0026 they actually told me about a few discrepancies they found themselves after the inspection (ovens needed to be cleaned, spots on driveway), \u0026 they offered to clean the carpets after I called them in desperation to understand the inspection results.  It took a week \u0026 3 requests to get the inspection results, but then they refused to give me an assessment and merely referred me to some postage-stamp-sized black \u0026 white photos that were contained in the report.  The tenant told me the inspector stated the carpets \"had to go\"; but they did not tell me whether it was due to damage or normal wear \u0026 tear.  Eventually the tenant just offered to have them cleaned, so I stopped asking for the \"professional opinion\" I knew I would never get from AZP.  Again I sent my own inspector to make an assessment, again they found obvious problems that should have been identified, but I just worked w/the tenants since AZP was obviously done making money from me, so they are done talking to me.  It's over!!","useful":7,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I was a frequent attender of the social gatherings and parties held by the complex at the front pool.\nAs a junior, a year later, I was also relieved to see that the parties had dwindled, as now I was focused on my budding career. The social atmosphere was never a problem.\nIn my junior year, I transfered from a two bedroom to a single, and this is where the trouble seemed to escalate. I had maintenance on speed dial- my fridge was constantly breaking, my water pipes were clogged, and a horrid smell was emitting from the combination of a broken fridge and a soiled drainage pipe. This problem, despite maintenance's frequent visits and \"fixed\" persisted for two years. I stuck it out, though, because I knew I would be moving shortly after graduation. \nOne month ago, I returned my keys and felt a sense of relief as I moved into a new apartment in Gilbert that does not leak air, does not smell moldy, and has working light fixtures. \nMy relief was short lived.\nA few day ago, I was notified that my bank account was negative $500. I quickly checked the balance and transactions, and noticed that although I cancelled recurring payments of Apache's auto-pay, my $700 rent still went out. I will admit here that I am at fault; I should have checked to see if it truly did cancel, but I thought a quick call to my old residency would fix this problem.\nI was informed, rudely, by the front office staff that there was no way to reverse this charge. The staff informed me as well that the manager would not be available to speak to until Monday, but \"We can return your check along with your security deposit within 30-60 business days.\"\nThis lead me to a different question: Where indeed was my security deposit? I left my single spotless. There may have been some \"living\" wear and tear (possible spots left on the carpet, hard water in the shower), but what I was told was the \"damage\" was unheard of.\n\nI was charged a fee of $150 for a deposit two years ago. I now find myself owing Apache $100. Why, you ask?  \n\nToilet cleaning fee: $25\nCounter-top cleaning: $55.00\nNew carpet (which Apache does anyway before leasing another room): $100\nWall repair: $75\n\nand a few outstanding odds and ends including \"drawer fixing\" (one screw was loose- I asked which drawer), which was a fee of $30.\n\nI requested an itemized list of said charges, only to be told that it had been sent and my address confirmed. I still have not received this list.\n\nI was then informed that, although 10 minutes prior to this discussion on my missing deposit it was stated that my $700 would indeed be returned, it seems now that they have no record of a $700 check.\n\nHere is how rent works at Apache:\nYou may choose to write a personal check, or you may use their automated system. I set my bank account up to deliver a personal check of $700 every 31st of the month in order for it to arrive at Apache by the 5th of the following month, which is when all rent is due. They usually cash all rent checks on the 9th- something I was aware of.\n\nMy $700 rent went out on the 31st of July, again, my mistake, and was just cashed yesterday. In order for me to be out $700, Apache MUST have cashed this check; they insist they have not cashed it and the money is still in my account.\n\nI was asked to provide a bank statement proving they cashed it, but I had to report in person to the complex by Monday before 4:00pm. I work full time in Queen Creek: there is no possible way this can happen. I was told with a brief 'sorry' that that was all that could be done.\n\nI am working with my bank to reverse the charges, but in the meantime, I advise any potential tenants to please be very careful when applying. Hidden fees and charges will sneak up on you and your lease will never end.","useful":8,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Dosas were crispy and cooked to perfection. The owner also came and met us and was very social and humble. Last course was Desserts: just too awesome to be explained. I would say the best gajar Halwa, I ate in US so far. Gulab Jamuns were very soft and they just melted in mouth. Badam Halwa was like a rich royal food.

I came here with a large group of coworkers to celebrate someone making a career move. This group has a bad habit of not making reservations, but they did this time and we got a great seatting arrangement in the very front of the restaurant where no one could miss us right when you walk in which was perfect as people would come a go throughout the hours that we were there.\n\nWhen my husband and I arrived, we found seats and started being social. After about 15 minutes, we saw the waitress come by to bring the check for a couple of people (we were late because we were waiting out a flash food alert up in PV). We made eye contact and held the menu in our hands to indicate our interest in ordering. We weren't too hungry and we were having fun so we were patient and understanding that she might just be super busy at this moment. After doing that for about 20 minutes, happy hour was coming to an end and we wanted to throw in our order before that happened so we went up to the bar to order. They got pissy with us, but when we explained the 40 minute wait, they worked with us and told us to continue the order and cash out with her. \n\nSome time later, we were still having fun and I wanted another drink. I snapped out of my conversation and noticed that it had been an hour with not as much as a water refill so I started making direct eye contact with the waitress again and trying to speak with her when she would pass. When that didn't work I went back to the bartender so see if we could cash out there. He told us he would get her attention and a couple minutes later our bills were at the table without as much as a word from the waitress when she dropped it off. She did however take the time to write \"Thanks! \" on the bill. \n\nI will happily admit that I can't stand Mill or most of Tempe for that matter and I was already not happy to be treking down south to a college town, but I wanted to send my friend off right so I sucked it up, paid for parking, and was extra careful to watch out for student driving and homeless people. This rating doesn't just apply to the Tempe location. I went to the Scottsdale one in my part of town and didn't have this bad of experience, but the staff was slow and seemed to be bothered by our orders. \n\nThe food is great though so I'll likely return and not put up a fuss next time someone wants to go here. I will however start being more honest with my tips since this is directly a wait staff problem. In summation, if you want amazing drinks, good food, and can put up with bad service come to Zipps and have a zipparita cause they are the best.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I see some people commented on the stairs, but they have a elevator if you can't make it down the stairs. The drinks are reasonably priced and the vibe of this place is great. I requested a bunch of 90s songs and they ended up have a 20 minute 90s marathon with music videos in the background and everything. I brought $60 cash with me for drinks and songs and ended up only spending $20 on two fishbowls and a beer which left plenty of money for song requests (the beer was for my husband and he had to help me with the second fishbowl because they are strong). The average cost for a request is $5 and on a busy night it will take them about 2 hours to get to your request with $5 attached to it. If you want to spend $20 they will play your song within about 30 minutes and if you are putting $40 and up they get to you right away. \n\nI can't stand Tempe, but when you go downstairs you won't even remember that you are in a college town. The patrons here are much better behaved than ASU students and everyone is just having a great time. I'd like to go back on a weeknight and see what it is like there.\n\nThe only reason that this place isn't a 5-star review is because they have no food. Like I said, if you put $5 with your request on a busy night you are going to be stuck there for 2 hours before your song goes on. I put in a request at 11pm with $5 and an hour an a half later my stomach was begging me for something and my tolerance was going way down on an empty stomach. Please, please, please offer some bar snacks! Even easy things that don't need to be cooked (I'm assuming that they don't have a kitchen) like bread with cheese and deli meats, nuts, veggies, pretzels, chips, or whatever is easiest for you guys would make this place perfect! Even throwing a vending machine in there would be great! I ended up leaving and was really disappointed that my song didn't play before I walked out, but I still had fun and will be back, however I'll probably try to bring in a candy bar or something.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0}

I'm curious if this has happened to other couples?  \n\nMaybe my previous post was not clear.  We did not ask for/pay for/contract for whipped cream between layers with the strawberries.  We ordered a cake with whipped cream just on the outside of the cake.  So Sept. we put money down for that cake specific cake.  Two weeks before our wedding,  the day the balance of the money was due on the cake, is when we were told Honey Moon Sweets would NOT do the cake we agreed on/paid for.  We even agreed HM Sweets could put butter cream around the edges of the layers so that strawberry juice wouldn't leak out, which is what HM Sweets was worried about, but HM Sweets still said NO, they would not do the cake we ordered back in Sept.  So I guess the customer's not always right at Honey Moon Sweets.  That was 4 1/2 years ago, so you may have a selective memory, but it was the biggest day of our life and the cake was an important element for us, so forgive me if I'm still a little \"frosted\" over the whole debacle.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0}

So let me begin by says giving 1 star is me being generous. I moved in May of 2015 and I have dreaded every part of this year. I've been so hopefully of when my least is up. You basically get what you pay for. \n    The property is extremely old, having being an old hotel. There is nothing appealing about the orange and blue, 60's layout( poor attempt of trying to be \"retro\"), and disgusting landscape. I was astonished to find out there is an Hoa fee. There is constantly trash everywhere and grounds are always gross. The only area they keep up is the front near the office and lake. The laundry rooms have to be the most revolting areas I've been in. I personally wile the inside of the washer and dryer every time I do laundry. I freak out if something falls on the ground as well because it smells straight of trash, and spiders and spider webs ALL over the place. The pool is GROSS. And it's sad because it's a beautiful laid out if they actually cared to keep up and invest in it. Outside of the terrible outdoor appearance is inside. When I first walked into my apartment. I was on the verge of tears knowing I had to stay here a whole year. Underneath my sink was falling apart and molding, trash still around the fridge from last tenant, my balcony door couldn't even open, balcony carpet was burnt and stained, kitchen cabinets falling apart, I didn't even have a hallway door. They never attached it back, the bedrooms where okay. My carpet was not cleaned. It was FILTHY, it's not beige more brown. The bathroom tile in the shower was a joke. It looked as if a 3rd grader did it. My mirrors are stained oddly And there's paint on them at will. I tried to decor as much as possible to help but there's only so much you can do. \n     Maintenance is a joke as well. I had a leak in my bathroom ceiling. I constantly called. Every other day as well as online reports to inform them and took forever for a response. They finally can. Fixed it and left the walls plastered, not sanded or painted properly and my bathroom vent off. Which looks it has t been cleaned since they built the place, so that's been great inhaling that for ablut 3 weeks cause they have not been back to complete what they started. I don't bother calling Maintenance. My father is very handy and fixed almost all my issues when I moved in because they don't respond timely or professionally at all. \n    Another great note about living here are how thinthe ceilings are. It's to the point every time my upstairs neighbor uses the bathroom and flushes I can hear it from my bedroom.... Joy.. \n     There is not mush to say  positive about this place. I'm happy they got rid of the old staff. They were rude beyond description. They new staff is nice and honestly it's not there fault because there is only so much you can do being assigned a property already in this condition. The one good thing is the lake. It's a great relaxing spot, the redid the leasing office and front area amazing. But um what about the rest of the property. It's to the point. I don't invite anyone over due to the embarrassment. I wouldn't recommend this property at all to anyone, any day. I'm sooooooo excited to be moving in 2 months I can't describe it. Sorry to be blunt. I wish someone had greatly told me what I just relayed to you. Excuse all of my typos.","useful":11,"funny":1,"cool":0}

The short of it - I wish we hadn't. \n\nService was generally good, the waitress was attentive and the restaurant had a suitable ambiance - a good combination of family style and traditional Italian.  The food, however, was a much different story.  My wife and I both ordered pizza - I ordered pepperoni and she ordered Canadian bacon with pineapple.  Both of our pizzas were the most absolutely tasteless, bland concoctions we have experienced.  There was literally NO SAUCE on either of our pizzas, just greasy cheese, a very flat, bland crust and a small amount of toppings.  Without sauce, the pizza was just terrible - it was dry, somewhat greasy from the cheese and it literally had no flavor whatsoever.  This was the most disappointing meal that I have had in quite some time and it came to $40 including tip for 2 pizzas, 2 soft drinks and 2 salads.  When I told the waitress about the quality of the food, she simply mentioned that they have a new person preparing the pizzas in the kitchen and that things may be a little off due to the transition.  It seems puzzling that someone, despite how new they are, could forget to put sauce on the pizzas.  Honestly, I'm not sure sauce alone would have been sufficient to revive Marcello's tasteless pies.\n\nIf you are hungry for pizza, you will be much better off buying a Tombstone or a Jack's for $4 at Walmart and cooking it yourself.  Or better yet, go to Boulders on Broadway or Grimaldi's where you will get excellent food and great service at a comparative bargain price.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Not only because of this location but mostly because of the company in general. \nRented a car this past weekend. We were meeting people in San Diego, neither me nor my girlfriend wanted to drive our cars, so we rented one. The plan was to drop it off in SD and drive back with our friends.\nAgent 1- (on the phone) - advised us that we can drop in San Diego with no \"drop off fee\"\nAgent 2 - (phone) - it will be $250 to drop off\nAgent 3 - (phone) -  it is $250, but they always waive it at the pick up spot. \n\nGet to the location. \n\nThe Agent there was very nice, unfortunately she couldn't help (not her fault) and was not very knowledgeable. She stated it was only $50 to drop in SD, so if we dropped on the first night it was about the same price as getting it the whole weekend. We were about to opt to that, but her manager stepped in and stated, no it's $250. We advised the manager about the situation and she gave us the WORST excuse of all time and offered no resolution. \n\"California tax makes it so we have to charge that $250, every state is different\" \n((spoiler alert)) - Hertz drop fee was free, AAA was, and even FOX rental cars (who?) was $14. So after being blatantly lied to, she followed it up with \"after march madness there were so many cars in AZ it was free\" -- wait, free? I thought California TAX was the reason it was so much? Thank you for not catching yourself in a lie, but I sure caught it. \nWanted to use a debit card, phone agent said that's fine, got there and they said I need 2 forms of ID, a $200 debit card \"hold\" and 2 utility bills to do it that way. I have a credit card, I have more than one! I didn't bother bringing any of them because the phone representative said nothing else was needed other than my debit card. \nBeing it was already Friday afternoon and we wanted to leave, we just took the car for the entire weekend. It was the same price anyway, but that's really not the point. \nNEXT -  Enterprise doesn't have a location drop point, we had to rent until Monday because you can't drop off with enterprise and do a key drop. they're only open until 3pm on Sunday and most locations aren't open at all. By the way, it's $35 to drop at the airport. It's cheaper to just keep it another day. Good way to FORCE your customers to buy another day Enterprise. \nThen to add to this great company's miracle work. \nGo to return the car today \n\"We can drive you home after you drop it off, so you won't need to worry about having anyone follow you or getting an uber\" - ok thanks....\nget there\nAh wait, it's 3.9miles, we can't do a drop that far. Sigh. \n\nWe had already looked up AAA rates, Hertz rates, expedia, etc. Enterprise was actually the HIGHEST, but went with them because they're the only company I ever have rented from in the past. I've never had a bad experience. HOWEVER, being that the phone support AND the physical location were so terrible leads me to believe they've made internal changes which force me to never return. Good job alienating your customers Enterprise! You won't be picking me up.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

My husband and I were very hungry after a long day out. I've never had Persian food before, and was very pleasantly surprised. He had a shish kabob chicken sandwich, which he enjoyed a lot, and I had the lamb shank. The lamb was delicately spiced but quite flavorful, reminiscent of Indian food but not overpowered by the heat of hot pepper that's so characteristic of Indian cooking. It's really hard to describe this meal because there's nothing like it. I loved the sauce that the lamb was cooked in, and the lamb was incredibly tasty. \n\nWe also shared a salad of tomato, cucumber, bell pepper and fresh mint. The vegetables were cut up very fine, which liberated the flavor. Everything was fresh, not just the mint. The rice that came with the lamb was loaded with dill and flavorful as well. There was a lot of it.\n\nThe owner and his son were very attentive. They gave us extra iced tea and let us linger at our patio table far into the afternoon (we were the only customers in the place). There was so much food, we took some home in a doggy bag.\n\nOrdinarily, I'd give this restaurant 4.5 stars, only because I ate there only once and don't have a lot of experience with it. We plan to return and try other things on the menu. The owner is kind and capable, so I hope he gets lots more business.\n\nSECOND VISIT May 11, 2017:  I downgraded my review to 3 stars after my second visit. The food was mediocre. The shish kabob was cooked too much, very tough and almost inedible. A young man (the son?), rather than the owner (the father, I believe), waited on us, and the difference in service heavily declined. The food was unremarkable. The salad, which I'd assumed would be a Persian staple of tomato, cucumber, bell pepper and fresh mint, cut up small, consisted of a few leaves of iceberg lettuce and tomato slices. I don't need to spend big bucks eating out for what I can easily throw together at home. \n\nAlso, this is an aside, but my dining companion, who ordered a sandwich, got a package of potato chips on the side (as he did the first time). This is cheap, reminiscent of vending machine fare. Surely a place that calls itself an authentic Persian restaurant can do better.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The first time a few months back didn't warrant a full review . I was there to hang out with a large group and had a cocktail before leaving. I did enjoy myself that evening and the atmosphere of La Bocca. A bit different than many other places on or just off Mill that cater more toward the college scene.  La Bocca is a nice change of pace.\n\nTonight, I really experienced La Bocca on a couples outing. We had a party of 8. We went here for food, drink and hanging out.\n\nI thought the food was very good. My wife and I started out with some bruschetta planks.  I really enjoyed the housemade pesto with fresh roma tomato and mozzarella, basil, roma tomato,  olive oil \u0026 balsamic. You get to choose 4 different options for your plate. After we finished, I wish I had more!\n\nMy wife and I also split a margarita pizza. The pizza was nicely baked and tasted really good. I wish there was a little more cheese on the pizza though. After the first bite, all the cheese came off and was just left with dough and sauce. The pizza reminded me of the pizza I had in Italy last summer\n\nFood wise, La Bocca hit's a home run. I think the food is well done, fresh and high quality.\n\nAs for beverages. Beside the various wines, there is a bar and beer. On Monday nights, most bottles of wine are half off.  I wanted a cocktail and had a mojito. The drink was okay. Not the worst mojito, but definitely not the best. There was way too much ice in the glass. Not my wisest $7 spent. Should have just had a nice glass of red wine instead! \n\nHere are some issues I had with La Bocca:\n-The bruschetta took as long to come to our table as the pizza did.\nI didn't expect the food to appear instantly, but the food should have been out in 10 minutes. The bruschetta orders came out closer to 30 minutes. \n\n-The front door and patio doors were left open and the people smoking on the patio carried inside. Not a fan of this at all, especially while I eat.\n\n-The service was up and down. Some areas were really good while other areas were sub par. Water came quickly, wine and other drinks came out a bit slower than they should.  Food delivery was slow (read above).  The server forgot about one check that was paid in cash and \n3/4 of the table received their check and receipt quickly. The other couple was completely forgotten above for an extended period of time and caused us to stay longer than expected. \n\nOverall, I liked the place and would give this establishment 3.5 stars. The rating could go up 4 stars (or maybe higher) with some of the inconveniences improved upon above.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

My rating is going to be about other features.\n\nThe Tempe Costco is far different than the locations I've experienced in California (San Jose, Mt. View, Sunnyvale etc). This Costco always has ample lanes open and rarely have I seen a line more than 2 or 3 carts deep. I think the longest I've waited in line is 10 minutes. At Costco, that is superb. Most times, the wait is no more than 5 minutes and I've gone at all times during the week and weekend.  \n\nI never understood why you would have 15 registers, but only half open (espeically on weekends). This Costco always seems to have the right amount of registers open with very few idle to meet the demand of the customers.\n\nThe Staff is always willing to assist you with an item. The folks handing out samples are very friendly and provide information on the product.\n\nRestrooms are also clean.\n\nThe only downside of Costco is the parking situation. Although the parking isn't nearly as bad as other locations I've gone too, you still have to deal with issues as carts in parking spots or stray carts because folks are too lazy to place in the proper location. Another issues is people blocking traffic to get that closer spot even if the parked car is just starting to load their items and takes 5 minutes to do so. Do yourself a favor and park in the area where less cars are at. More often than not, you'll be walking by the folks who are still waiting to park. The stray carts still might be a problem.\n\nI'm always a fan of the snack bar and the many food items and treats you get here. $1.50 hot dog and soda combo, the pizza for 1.99 etc. \n \nRemember, Costco, only accepts Cash, Debit, Amex or check.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

This review is to let folks know that this location is a little different from other locations that you have visited.\n\nThis Wal Mart is very new! This Wal Mart was placed inside an old Meryn's department store at the corner of Rural and Southern. As such, this isn't your typical Wal Mart. Each department is smaller than what you would usually expect.  Walking around the store, you can tell certain departments are smaller and condensed compared to other local Wal Marts in Mesa or the location on Elliott in Tempe.\n\nThe other day I went to Wal Mart to look for some bar soap that I've bought at Wal Mart many times. This location only sold Dial bar soap.\n \nThe food/bakery/produce/meat section is a little smaller than what you might be used to at other locations. What is offered should be more suitable to fullfill most of your shopping needs though.\n\nOne thing that irks me about this Wal Mart, is they don't have the hand held baskets when you only need to buy a few items. You need to get a cart or hope you can carry everything in your hands. I've inquired about this problem and was told that management has heard this complaint and is working on it.

For the most part, the complex was generally quiet, at least on my end.\n\nThere are many things to like about CityScape. Cityscape is close to ASU, close to shopping and to many major freeways-60/10, 101.\n\nThe grounds are kept generally clean although I never enjoyed the 6:30 am lawn mover outside my window.\n\nThe inside of the apartments are nice with a decent size kitchen. I believe almost all units have washer and dryers included.\n\nThere is a nice clubhouse that has computers, tvs and dvd rentals. The staff also have several functions at the pool/clubhouse throughout the year. \n\nSome really nice things about the complex is the nice pool. hot tub and patio area with propane BBQ. There is an onsite gym with several cardio machines, weight machines and free weights.\n\nThere are several BBQ pits located throughout the complex.\n\nMaintenance was always friendly and quick to fix and issues, \n\nThere are a few items that weren't great.

We decided to go for our anniversary this year. We usually go to Roy's. I wanted a 6:30 reservation weeks ago but all they had was 5:30 so we went. The restaurant was almost empty til about 6:45. This is a mainly valet place and we do not like to valet. The parking lot is so far away we were exhausted before even getting there.\nThe waiter was friendly and knowledgeable but not very attentive. I ordered the Sonoran Tea cocktail and didn't like it at all. I didn't want to say anything and just left it there, mostly full. Our waiter NEVER noticed and we had a hard time even getting water refills. As well, when they initially filled my water, they spilled a little puddle and never wiped it up. It sat there on the table the entire 2 hours we were there.\nMy husband had the sirloin which was cooked to perfection with a homemade BBQ sauce that was unique. The side of bacon fat fries were very tasty but needed salt.\nI ordered the steelhead trout with crispy Spanish rice and a side of collard greens. The collard greens side was nothing like it mentioned on the menu but was delicious; a bit bitter and crunchy with sweet cranberries. Trout was cooked to perfection.\nOverall, the food was delicious and worth the exorbitant prices but the service made it not so great. We waited a long time to be served and for the bill and had empty water glasses and a full cocktail almost the whole time.","useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":0}

The waffle had great flavor with chorizo and green chilies cooked into it.  Unfortunately, they used canned green chilies which were tasteless and full of skins.  I go to New Mexico each year and buy green chilies to roast and freeze. It's not hard to use real green chilies... My dish was $15.95 and NOT worth that cost.\nMy husband got the chicken fried steak which was very tender. One of his 2 over easy eggs had a broken yolk and it was covered in gravy. Yummy but disappointing.

Bought my seat 2 weeks prior to it, and everything was fine and dandy until the morning of the classroom session. \nI walk into the Holiday Inn they were holding the class at, only to find out from the front desk that the class was cancelled! No phone call within the past 24 hours saying it wouldn't be happening, nor was there an email saying anything- they just left me (and whomever else may have been signed up) out in the cold. Okay, no big deal- I start for home, still confused.\n\nA few minutes after I get home, I see the call. At the exact time the classroom portion was going to start, I had a missed call and a voicemail. I verified that the number indeed belonged to the Scottsdale branch before listening to the voicemail. What I got was something along the lines of \"This is so-and-so from Driving Arizona, for Alyssa. The class was cancelled. Alyssa was rescheduled to the June class.\" The voice did mispronounce my name, but that's beside the point- there was still no explanation on why it was cancelled (there's no need for detail- 'personal issues' or 'not enough students' would've sufficed), and by now, I'm just beyond annoyed.\n\nAnyway, I decided to get my money back- mid-June is a long time away, and the sooner I can get through driving school and becoming a licensed driver, the better. So I called the number and explained calmly: \"I was a student in the class that was cancelled today, and I'd like a refund- I need to find a different driving school soon.\" \nThe man on the other line (Cane, if my memory is right) was silent for a good couple of seconds and then told me \"You know, you don't need us to start the driving portion- you have a permit, don't you?\" The tone in his voice and the line itself rubbed me the wrong way, so I explained why I couldn't and reiterated that again, I need a refund. He caved and said that it'll come by Monday.\n\nThis was only my experience in one location, so your results can, may, and will vary.

I wanted to do a shoot for my husband for our first anniversary (the paper anniversary). Having to reschedule my shoot several times due to a surprise summer job, and later a last minute vacation, Lynn was very accommodating and to say the least, very patient with all the reschedules! \nWe had a consultation early on that laid out how the shoot would work and what my package options were (there's definitely something for everyone). I settled on a special package that included a photo album, digital copies on a usb, and a digital brag book for our phones. \n\nI wasn't particularly nervous going into the shoot, as I am already very comfortable with my body, but for anyone having any doubts, I assure you that Lynn makes everything not only comfortable, but fun! Though I did not partake, there is always wine available at the shoot to help ease your nerves too! My hair and makeup was done by Erica and I'd highly recommend doing the same. It makes it so much easier to jump right into the shoot and you don't have to worry about your hair or makeup getting messed up before hand. Besides, Erica does an amazing job and made me feel gorgeous!\n\nThe shoot is laid out in an apartment and Lynn walks you through all your poses, even facial expressions. She definitely knows what she is doing! It was amazing going through the photos after she was done with them....and SO HARD to choose between them for the book! She had me looking gorgeous! I must have gone over the photos a half dozen times before I settled on my final choices; again Lynn was very patient :)\n\nMy book took a couple weeks to come in and I couldn't wait. I checked my email compulsively for the message that it had arrived. The book was an amazing quality and Lynn presented it in a pretty, sturdy, gray box with a pink bow. To say that my husband loved it would be an understatement! He was blown away! And knowing that he can carry the digitals on his phone and computer was a bonus!\n\nIn short, I could not be happier with my experience and have already mentioned it to several of my friends!

I first came here shortly before shipping off to Army Basic Training in 2011. I had suffered from shin splints for quite some time and was determined to not have to deal with them during training. The staff I dealt with at that time were very knowledgeable and professional. They were able to put me in the right kind of shoe based upon how I run and the pain that I was experiencing. I also had some custom insoles made and I've never had a problem since then.\n\nI've bought the same shoe (albeit an updated model) since then and have received the same great service as I did in 2011. After a month of wearing my new shoes I noticed some tread had started to peel away from the sole. I took them back and they swapped them out for a brand new pair, no questions asked.\n\nI visited today with very specific requirements for what I was looking for. Kirsty (look for the pretty girl with beautiful brown eyes) was incredibly helpful. I was actually surprised when she came up to me to see if I needed anything as they are usually busy and I didn't see her when I walked in. She ran to the back 5 or so times and did everything she could to get me exactly what I needed. I had been to several other retail stores (for other needs) before coming in here and it was very refreshing to receive such a high level of customer service and feel so welcome. She genuinely seemed to want to help and she did just that.\n\nThis store never seems to disappoint!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I have been a very loyal customer. For every occasion I needed my nails done, I went to Jeniza. Unfortunately the quality of the service I've received has declined. I feel like the manicurists are not given enough time for each customer. They rush through the appointments just to get to the next customer (mind you, I most certainly show up on time to my appointments). Since they are not given enough time, the quality of the manicure is not very good either. The last time that I went, I picked a color, the girl put on the basecoat and one coat of the color. Apparently the \"brush\" was giving her problems but it turned out that the polish was dry! She came back and told me that they did NOT have the same polish. I was forced to pick a color I did not want. When I show up to a business, pay for a service and go looking for something in specific, I would think they would have it available. I was very disappointed. My mom and sister also go to Jeniza and lately, have experienced the same discontent with the quality of the service. We have all decided to not return because of this. Jeniza nails is not the same business it used to be.

I can't say it as well or in so few words - so I will just tell you what happened to me.\n\nSeriously - I went there for the sushi and trust me, I was alone in that endeavor.  Everyone else was there for the scene.  What has been said here is true.  It is loud music, loud people, over the top decor.\n\nWe sat at the sushi counter, not because they were busy, but mostly because we couldn't get the host's attention.  The \"chef\" (and I use that term generously here) who was in front of us had completely no idea what he was doing.  Granted he said he was new there, but he took our order sheet and handed it off to the next guy because he said he couldn't handle it.  I can understand \"I'm still learning the ropes.\" so I cut him some slack and tried to make conversation.  \"So, do you like to make sushi at home.\"  \"No, I've never made sushi before, but I like to eat it.\"  You do not get to stand in front of customers, profess you know nothing, and cut cream cheese for a 1/2 hour.  Yuck!\n\nWe ordered: toro sashimi, hamachi sashimi, saba oshi sushi, uni sashimi, some crispy-spicy tuna thing, and some veggie tempura.  \n\nThe saba oshi sushi completely threw them.  Why even have a special order line if you can only make the 7 or 8 standard items you have on the menu?  So the \"experienced chef\" to whom the menu was handed said, \"you want saba sushi\"?  I wanted to be clear so I said, \"Mackerel OSHI sushi, you know, box pressed Mackerel.\"  I got the \"Oh, ok\" but I was skeptical.  Then he kept asking me crazy questions, \"You want that with rice? Are you sure you just want Mackerel? No other fish with that?\"  I offered to just let him give us Saba Nigiri, much simpler.  If you don't have the box or you can't do oshi sushi, no problem - I gave him every out.  We basically ended up with Saba Don - nothing like what I ordered and no willingness to admit none of them had any idea what they were doing.  And it was way sub par saba at that.\n\nSo, they were out of the toro.  No apologies, just \"We don't have that.\" We tried to order the scallop dish as a substitute, but that never came.  In the end, all the better I figure.\n\nThe crispy-spicy tuna thing was almost ok.  Except the spicy was mostly jalapeno and just totally wrong for the dish and the crispy stuck to my teeth.\n\nThe tempura was the only thing that was close to good.  It was too thickly battered though and didn't come close to tempura at its finest.\n\nThe uni was gross.  I took one bite and left it there.  It was slimy and not fresh at all.  I didn't realize when I walked in, but I really shouldn't have ordered it.  This is not the place anyone who cares about fresh fish really eats.  The uni was never going to be a big seller or any good at a place like this.  This is where people go to drink silly fru fru drinks, eat exorbitant rolls that don't even resemble sushi, and to have their conversation drown out by loud music so they don't even have to think.\n\nOK on top of it being a horrible experience, the fish just sucked.  Really, terrible quality, terrible selection.  \n\nI came here on a recommendation, but can not believe I didn't check Yelp first.  Shame on me.  I will not be fooled again.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1}

They sat me down as soon as I walked in and when I asked to pay it only took 2 minutes. The food is much fresher now compared to when the old chefs still worked there and did not care much. \n\nI might go again next month for a snack given my better experience.

An IPad or something electronic would fit better. \n3) I was let down they did not decorate for any holidays. Perhaps next year. \n4) A lot of the plates, curtains and chairs need to be replaced.

The old Nello's was a family favorite dating back to the 90's. I thought I'd be more skeptical, but I was just hungry and had a craving for pizza. To start the pizza was very good, and the deep dish crust was even Nello's-esque. In fact the \"pizza sticks\" appetizer we got was nothing short of a direct replica of the old \"pizza crust\" app. Although the new app can be ordered in three sizes which couldn't be done with the old app. If it sounds like I'm comparing the two heavily, it's probably because the restaurant is still nearly identical to the old one. Most of the same sports memorabilia is still hanging exactly where it was, all the tables and booths are the same billiards green tables left behind. You can't help feel like you're in the twilight zone, everything looks and feels the exact same, but it's not, it's Happy Joes now. So if you can get over that strange feeling of being somewhere the same but different then you'll have a tasty pizza, prepared well with quality toppings, friendly service, and a yummy sundae to top it all off. The only negative I noticed was the servers didn't seem to clear the table until after you left, so at the end of the meal, we had a messy table that we had to maneuver around when boxing up leftovers and signing the check. It would've been much appreciated to have the table cleared right away, but other than that I have to say I was impressed, even when I assumed I couldn't be.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":2}

Once back in December and another on May 24th.  In December I just had a small issue which was done with no problem.  I believe it was adding a bracket to my battery.  I believe I worked with Anthony and he wasn't very communicative at all.  I told him I would be waiting around and he called me fairly fast to tell me what the issue was and he would call back once it was done, but there was a car ahead of mine.  I waited another hour and a half at a cafe with no call back, so finally I walked back and my car had been done and waiting but he had never called to tell me it was ready.  He didn't really have good customer service skills or really took the time to explain much, but I waived it away thinking they are in the car service, not people service.\n\nBecause they had such great reviews, I decided to stop by again when I noticed my car had white smoke coming out of the hood.  I thought maybe it was water/coolant burning off my radiator, and it was NOT over heating.  I took it back to Anthony on May 24th.  He told me it was my head gaskets and because my car is a 98 (lexus gs300 fyi) he said he would recommend an engine replacement for 4,600.  He also said my car was overheating.  On top of this, he was surly, and short with explanations.  I did not have the money for the car so i took it back home with me and decided to take it to someone else the following week.  I didn't have any other way of getting to work, so I drove it couple more times and never noticed the car over heating. \n\nI took it to another mechanics and explained that the last repair shop told me it was my head gaskets and wanted to confirm if i had to replace the engine or if anything could be done to repair the gaskets.  I explained it was white smoke coming out of the front of my car and they immediately suspected the radiator.  They were very nice and took the time to actually show me what they were doing.  And they showed me it was a crack in the radiator that was causing the issue.  I saw the leak with my own eyes.  I had them double check the head gaskets just in case it was 2 issues and nope, no problems.  I had the radiator replaced for a fraction of the cost. \n\nAnd STILL, in a effort to be fair, I waited months to place this review just to make sure my car continued to run without any issues.

The owner said if I couldn't make it any faster, they would have to keep my dog and board her.

I had paid the owner in advance for 4 days so I went to her and begged her for my dog, as I am still grieving my lost cat.

I believe that a service like this, used by working adults, should have some arrangement that works for when you have to work late.  Otherwise they are a good boarder and doggie day care, just whatever you do DO NOT WORK LATE.  In my job that is impossible to avoid. I also felt she was very unforgiving about it.  I wish she had said, come and get your dog, but never do it again, then at least I could be sitting here with my dog instead of her being sad in the boarding facility overnight for the sin of her owner being held hostage in a meeting.....In the meantime, I will be looking on yelp at the other doggie day cares to find one with a more lenient day care policy and I am going to let this day care provider keep my little extra money, as they have really broken my heart.","useful":8,"funny":2,"cool":0}

She suggested pizza so everyone else being closed at 11 p.m., I decided to try Oliveo's as I had a flyer from them....\n\nSo at 11:15 p.m. we ordered our pizza.  They told us it would be 45 minutes, a standard amount of time for a delivery.\n\nWe were pretty hungry, but we also hadn't seen each other for a long time and got engrossed in conversation.  So about 12:30 we both realize that the pizza hasn't gotten there yet.  So at 12:35, according to my phone, I called Oliveo's to find out what was going on.  I got a pretty grumpy person who informed me they were short staffed with only two people and that my pizza was on its way but he couldn't really tell me when I would get it.\n\nAbout 12:37, the driver, who sounded pretty stoned in my opinion, called and told me he was sorry to inform me that my pizza was going to be 15 minutes late.  So i said drive safely, but we are starving!  He told me that there was one house ahead of mine and explained they only had two people working and they had \"run out of pizza\".  WTF, LOL... he he the pizza place RAN OUT OF PIZZA... lol... that cracked us up.\n\nAbout 1:30 a.m.  he finally arrived and gave us a cold pizza and our pasta we ordered.  So the order was \"only\" two hours late.  After he left my friend and I burst out laughing our **sses off because the driver WAS FULLY BAKED.  No, really his EYES were like LARGER than his head.  We hadn't seen any one that stoned for quite some time, ourselves having changed our own wild ways some time back....\n\nThe pizza was cold but tasty and the pasta was rather tasty too, but in all honesty I can never order from this place again, sadly.  2 hours late is WAY too late, the first guy I talked to on the phone was short with me and unpolite, the stoned driver was very easy going (lol) but no one offered us any rebate of cost or coupons or anything to make up for this extraordinarily bad customer service.  \n\nI would generalyl call the place during the day to talk to them about it, but we were busy having one last little bit of time together before i took her to the airport and now my work week started, so sorry to yelp you without calling you Oliveo's, but really, in my opinion this was so poor that I feel fine about not really giving you prior warning of my poor review.  \n\nAlso how can you \"run out of pizza\"...

I knew I wanted to have a more pleasant experience than the nail salon ones I had prior, where the cost is less but the waxing is not good or neccessaily sanitary. For starters European Wax Center uses their own patented wax, it is a dark color and requires no wax strips to pull it off after it's on. It is all self contained, meaning they apply it and it takes a minute to harden, then they peel it off. It is just the wax meeting your unwanted hair, oh and an expert waxer. There is less waste with this method and so far what seems to be a cleaner wax. The rooms are well lit and sanitary.\n\nIf you go know that hey will only hold your appointment for 7 minutes after the scheduled time. After that you will have to reschedule. I got a same day appointment fairly easy the day before Mother's Day, so maybe people were busy with those preparations? I got a very skilled woman named Brandy at the Tempe location near near Baseline. She had a good attitude, very professinal and friendly. She gave me a pretty good wax, there are only a few stray hairs that I'll tweeze away due to breakage and not missed patches (it happens). What I did not get was damaged skin, red blotches, burnt skin, or having to shave a whole patch of unwaxed area afterward. I may have found the perfect place, but we shall see in this grow out period. It's only been 5 days since my wax, so I'm giving 4 stars for now.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I'd inadvertently left without signing my receipt or taking my credit card. When I went back the next day to sign and leave a tip, I was told that gratuity had already been included. This is CREDIT CARD FRAUD according to what my credit card company said regarding the incident. I asked to speak to the management on several occasions and was unable to reach anyone or receive a reply.\n\nI've been coming to House of Tricks since they first opened, and had always enjoyed the experience. Sure, they had some rough patches when their head chef left, and after a year or so, things gradually appeared to settle back into a groove. While the food doesn't compare to what it was, it's now pretty decent.  This current staff however, is rough and untrained. But the old staff, including bartenders, aren't what they used to be either. When this happens, I look to management.  \n\nEverything trickles down from the top, and Robin, if you expect your team to be top notch, maybe it's time to look at the top.

Especially when at least half of t)e items on the menu contain pastrami!\nThird mthe corned beef i got instead was so fatty and tough it was hard to eat.\nFourth I had to wait half an hour after I finished eating to have my plate cleared and get a check. \nFifth when I left at about 7:50 they had locked the front door and wanted me to go out into their very dark parking lot through a side door. There were several other tables still eating but they turned out the lobby lights after I left - closing time is at 8. \nLast the staff - while not really rude - had NO interest in the customers. They blew everything off, didn't speak except to tell me the front door was locked (one girl said it wasn't and opened it for me). They made it abundantly clear that they could care less about their work- and I am a very uncrabby easy-going diner.\nOh, yeah, and the bagels I bought to bring home were hard as a rock.\nIt will be a LONG time before I return.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I've been to Café Rio four times since they opened. I'm not big on fast Mexican but found the food at Café Rio far superior to chipotle or Qdoba.  Yes there is a slight weight but I think the flavors of the food are very good. Each is distinct and very flavorful, though hot there is not really hot. The problem with this place is that two of the times I was there the food was basically room temperature. Temperature of the food is so low that I have considered contacting the health department because I suspect it is not being held at a hot enough temperature.

My wife and I visited around 15 centers and had nearly given up finding a center we felt fully confident in until we found Maple Bear.  After our initial visit I know this would be the right place.  Management is professional and organized, the center itself is very clean.  The providers there are engaged with the kids and parents and communicate often.  I knew the center was a good one when our child would mention on weekends if she could go to school for the day - or were not fun parents :).\n\nConsidering that child to provider ratio is better than AZ requirements, the price is more than fair.  The only other center that we found with equivalent ratios is Bright Horizons, which we did take our daughter to for awhile.  When you compare fees between the two, Maple Bear is a far better value.  You pay less without giving up the most important attribute of a daycare - consistent, safe and engaged quality care for the kids.\n\nThe physical layout of the center has a large indoor play area when necessary but it's a smaller center than other daycares which allows the center from not having too many kids.  The outdoor play area is split into two, one for the younger kids and the other for older.  I do like that the location of the Center is a bit remote off to the side as it keeps cross traffic to a minimum and keeps things quiet.  \n\n\nCons - only one, parking lot directly across the center is a bit small and it can fill up during peak times.  However, it's not like you have to sit in your car for 5 minutes for a space.  There's plenty of parking just to the north of the center and the walk isn't far by any means.  \n\nI fully recommend Maple Bear and would suggest anyone in need of daycare to pay them a visit.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I've been to AhiPoki and Pokitrition but Pokedon tops in terms of freshness and variety.  I had yellowtail, salmon and tuna bowl with many of the standard options (seaweed salad, crab salad, edename) but I never had a PokeBowl with pineappple before and it was a great contrast to the other flavors.  I had the garlic ponzu and it was the best sauce I've ever had on a poke bowl, even compared to the bowls I've had in Southern CA where Poke has been a trend for at least 2.5 years now.  \n\nI do like that they have grill options.  I didn't try any on my first visit but since my kid doesn't do raw fish it's nice to have options for her.  One thing to note, the online menu at this time has Gyudon (Beef Bowl), which was another reason I trekked from south tempe to this spot, but sadly they don't.  They do have steak teriyaki but Gyudon is completely different.  \n\nGreat place, looking to try again sometime this week.\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nThey now have Gyudon and it's excellent.  I love their Poke but sometimes I'll come here just for Gyudon.    Have some with red/pink ginger and it's a great filling meal.  There's only two other places that I know of that serve Gyudon in the local area, one in Tukee which is also very good but a bit pricey and one in the Chinese mall in Mesa which I'm not  fan of.  Also, I've had their Chicken Teriyaki, eggrolls and gyoza, all very good to excellent as well.  Just so you know this isn't a bogus review, I had their Chicken Katsu and I wasn't a fan.

For my first class, Reba was the instructor.  Great first class to start with as my impression of Reba is that she takes Bikram Yoga seriously without being serious.  It's a bit intimindating at first walking into a 105 degree hot room and seeing folks walk in unphased by the heat.  Reba took a bit of my nervous energy off.\n\nBeen at it now for two and half weeks and the heat isn't intimidating anymore, in fact it's a bit welcoming.  The first week was a bit rough but by the second week I found myself wanting to find time to attend even more  I prepared myself at the start just to attend regularly three days a week, however I'm already attending five days a week now and considering going daily.\n\nAfter starting to take the classes, the best benefit I've found is my work outs outside of class.  My weightlifting and cardio endurance and flexibility have improved greatly in this short period.  One benefit that surprised me is the cardio throughout the class.  It's mentioned on their site as one of their benefits, but I really didn't believe it.  I call it sneaky cardio as at first you won't notice the build up, but once a posture is done, you'll feel your heart pumping.  \n\nAs far as specific to the studio all the teacher's have different approaches even though the class in itself is essentially the same.  Some make it fun, others push hard, while others give the value of each posture and others stress technique.  It's a good way to learn.  One thing to make sure you do is to hydrate before and after class.  You will sweat a lot in class.  Although I hydrated well before class, I didn't after class and I got a stinging headache.\n\nThe only con is that it's expensive.  I'm trying to figure out a way to pay for this after my Groupon expires.  It would be nice for them to offer a 6 month cycle option.  The one month, three month, punch cards and monthly aren't that cost effective and the annual option is a lot to drop in a day.  However, I am considering it!\n\nI'll sum up Bikram this way.  Every couple of classes I'll think to myself \"what the heck am I doing here, this is brutal!\"  However, AFTER the class I always feel accomplished, energized and looking forward to the next class.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":1}

We perused the huge menu for quite some time, thought about getting an appetizer, but ended up skipping the app because we figured we would be there all night long if we did. (in retrospect, a smart move.)\n\nWhen the food came, it was pretty good, but a little bland. I'd maybe try different dishes if there's a next time. I could see people complaining that the portions are on the smaller side, but I thought they were OK. Not great, but okay. \n\nMinus a star for the fact that our wine never came until our food showed up, and I had to politely remind our server. Being on a date, this really was killer. Would have been nice to loosen up convo with a nice glass of wine, and we ended up both getting one glass instead of two. \n\nAll in all, super disappointing. Thought it was going to be a fun, interesting experience, and looked forward to doing something different. But this place is firmly OUT of my \"dating restaurants\" rotation. Maybe I'll come back with friends? If we had a super nice waitress who suggested dishes and treated us well, it could have been great. (and, it doesn't have a very romantic ambiance... we were so far apart when sitting at our \"table for 2\" that we joked about having convo via carrier pigeon.) \n\nFactor in the fact that it's kind of expensive, and yeah... 2 stars all the way.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The larger guy  who initially took my order was decent enough, though I can't help but notice some guy passed out in a booth. The cashier has to wake him up... it is the cook. Not a great start.  As i wait for my food  two girls come in yelling,  im not phased until they walk behind the counter and find out they are employees.

The dark haired girl was also argumentative with a guest simply asking if the game could be turned on outside.

Took the poor guy one whole minute to get his question understood.\n\nI did not have high expectations for Geno's to start but this place is like a bad movie restaurant.

If you just want to skip to the point. Scroll to the bottom and read the conclusion. \n\n\nHonestly, I've been with sprint for 4 years and this location is horrible. You will wait for over an hour just to see a sales associate who may or may not be the most helpful person behind the counter. With that being said, Andrew is the best sales rep I have ever encountered at this location. I promise you when you call and make an appointment, please ask for Andrew if you want someone who is super friendly and is knowledgeable. He actually cares about the customer and will do anything for them. I can't stress this enough, it is worth the wait to get him as your sales rep. \n\nTwo weeks ago I went to sprint to upgrade my IPhone 6 to a 7 and I had Andrew as my sales rep. He was amazing! Unfortunately, my screen was broken so I had to replace it before getting a new phone. So, I replaced it and went back to Sprint. I was waiting for Andrew, but like I said, you will wait forever! I had a birthday party to attend afterwards and I couldn't wait for ever so I had David Gubich help me. Worst sales rep ever. A week prior, Andrew told me about the apple forever plan. I asked David. He said they got rid of that about two and a half weeks ago and I told him how only a week ago Andrew told me about it. Then he said, \"Oh, yeah well that only works if you buy the phone in store since we don't have the phone you want in store (IPhone 7 32gb Rose Gold) that can't apply to you.\" Which I later found out was a complete lie. He also just handed me a tablet and said here just sign this lease. So I did. I had to pay sales tax which was 32.23 and I gave him 35. He said \"So, we don't have change.\" How in the world does a company not have 2 dollars and some change in store.... That was a little ridiculous if you ask me. Anyways, last thing I told him was I wanted to switch my plan that Andrew told me would make my bill lower. And David said \"Yeah it won't make your bill lower it will be about the same.\" Once again, was wrong. Also, when he ordered my phone. He didn't even look at my phone to see if my phone was eligible to be turned in. My phone could have still been broken so when I would go pick up my new phone they could have told me I needed to fix it before anything could happen. Later on, Andrew told me that Is the first thing the sales rep has to check. And David didn't. \n\nI come back a few days later to pick up my phone and I made sure to wait until I could see Andrew. I told him about my horrible experience with David Gubich and he reassured me that everything David told me was wrong. Andrew fixed everything, got my bill lower, clarified everything that went wrong with my encounter with David, and did it with a smile. I would give Andrew 10/10 if I could. \n\nIn conclusion, if you are going to this location expect a wait. Don't have plans you NEED to attend at a certain time. And when you go, wait for Andrew!!! If you get a man named David Gubich, turn around and sit right back down because he will NOT help you.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

(I love La Bocca)  We went here last Saturday evening.  It was the only place we passed on Mill Ave. that was not jam-packed.  That should have been a big clue not to go in, but we really wanted to check this place out.  \n     The beer seems over-priced; 12 oz. beer for the price of 16 oz. at comparable places, and the selection was not impressive.  As for the food, quite bluntly, it sucked!  We had a burger, brat and split the large fries.  (We wanted a pretzel, but they were out!  They supposedly make them \"fresh\" daily, but were out since Friday night.  Hmm, couldn't make any today???)    The burger and brat had no taste what so ever.  Very disappointing.  The fries were good, but the \"large\" is served in a paper  pouch the same size as a Small fries at McDonald's.  Seriously, this is a Large??????\n     We were going to check this place out sooner or later.  I'm glad it was sooner.  I won't be back, and I'm shocked at the positive reviews of this place.

I really hate when businesses treat you differently because you have a groupon. Me and my mother went in and both were bossed around about being late and not picking out colors quickly enough. When I sat down my water was so hot I couldn't put my feet in right away ( I like hot water, but it's winter I can't just plunge in) my tech comes over and pushes both my feet in! Guess I'm in. She starts on the pedicure and cut me a few times removing my cuticles. While she's doing that a gentleman comes over and slips the paraffin wax on my hands. The paraffin wax and hand massage felt good. My tech asks if I need callus remover, which at every other salon is $5, they charge $7 and didn't even do the entire bottom of my foot. When it comes time for my foot paraffin wax they slip the bag on my foot and I screamed because it was so hot. I tell her I'm in pain and she starts massaging the liquid around my foot so now my entire foot is burned! I should have called it quits then but my mom next to me wasn't complaining and I wanted her to enjoy. The hot towels were scorching and the stone massage lasted maybe 5 min. My manicure was also very clumpy and cloudy and started peeling off the next morning. Looked like all their polish was really old. I won't be returning.

I was out playing in the desert so she called The Sunny Plumber, who arrived shortly after I came home.  He told me one of our water heaters was out and the bull would be $5400 since it was a high efficiency water heater.  He pointed to rust dripping below the water heater and said the internal jacket had failed.  He then said he could put in an electric heater for $2400 but I would have to hire an electrician to wire up 220 V.\n\nI own a number of rental properties in Phoenix so I called the woman who works for my real estate company to tell me who we use for water heaters.  She told me it was Harry Roud, who has always done a fantasic job with our air conditioners.  Harry came out within a few hours and within ten minutes told me there was nothing wrong with the water heater, that it was simply a plugged condensate drain from the PVC vent.  He asked if the Sunny Plumber took off the bottom cover; I said, \"I don't think so.\"  Harry then did that and showed me the insulation was perfectly dry and said if the internal jacket had failed, there would be water all over the garage.  He said the rust was from a leaking fitting.  And the check valve the Sunny Plumber said failed was fine.\n\nOh, by the way, I had to shoot Harry an email to tell him to invoice me - so far, no bill.\n\nThe Sunny Plumber is a complete ripoff.

The owners are so very kind and everytime I go they have no problem helping me dig through the childrens books and they always know off the top of their head just how many Dr Seuss books they have so we aren't looking for no apparent reason. \n\nI'll always have fond memories of this place providing me with my very first 1st edition Dr Seuss book ;}","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1}

She was a rescue that came from a puppy mill and and an abusive master. I love her with all my heart but I swear you can look at her wrong and she'll fall deathly ill. \n\nLast year I took her in when she was very sick and they diagnosed her with pyrometra. The doctor was so helpful and informative and even let me set up a payment plan because I couldn't afford the surgery up front. \n\nBy now they know her and her various issues. A few months back I took her in because she was starting to growl in the dark at the foot of my bed. They checked her for night blindness and her hearing then determined that she's just a grumpy old lady. They didn't charge me for the visit like most vets would have. \n\nThey've also been very good about keeping me from having to visit. Before I came here I would have to take Lola to the vet at least once a month, but now our visits are few and far between. \n\nThe receptionists and nurses are sweet as pie and made me feel very comfortable when I was bawling my eyes out waiting for my dogs surgery to be finished. \n\nAlright so, in the end...I love it here","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":1}

We went on a double date and I was less than pleased. First off the recipes were sort of hidden and the line was moving way too fast so I couldn't search for them. Instead I ended up frantically putting on random spices and hoping it would taste good. \n\nThe waitress was really rude to us when we asked her questions about the location and restaurant. Since I didn't use an actual recipe my food was kind of gross.\n\nIf you want good mongolion go to YCs. If you're in Tempe Marketplace, skip this place and get some Slices or something.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It was the one that you went to if all the others were busy and the easiest one to sneak underage kids into. \n\nI miss the old art and Alice in Wonderland type chairs, but everything else has been improved GREATLY. The music isn't too loud or soft, the girl at the front was so friendly and helpful (it was my friends first time with hookah), and they had a wide variety of flavors. \n\nThe ONLY problem I have is that they don't serve drinks or food. Even if they aren't going to have food they should at least do fountain drinks. People get thirsty!\n\nEdit: The owner actually contacted me to tell me that due to some stupid rules they can't do fountain drinks but they do sell bottled drinks at the front. That alone shows an owner that cares!\n\nFive stars all around!","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It's right next to Red Robin which is my all time favorite American chain. So naturally I never go there since I'd much rather have Red Robin. I'm glad my parents convinced me to come with them though.\n\nEverybody was satisfied with their meal and their salad bar looked very fresh. My grandfather took part in it and each time he came back I was surprised at the abundance of things he managed to find there. \n\nMy meal was smoked salmon with broccoli and there weren't any complains there. The server was polite and attentive. Honestly I don't have any complaints. The prices were a little higher than I'd expected but well worth it. The atmosphere was nice and quiet and relaxed. I can always appreciate that. \n\nGreat place for a classy simple American meal.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}
